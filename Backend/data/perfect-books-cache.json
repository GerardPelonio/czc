Just pick up the phone.\r\nIt solved them all--and all the same way!\r\n\r\n\r\n     2\r\n     B\r\n     R\r\n     0\r\n     2\r\n     B\r\n\r\n\r\nby KURT VONNEGUT, JR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEverything was perfectly swell.\r\n\r\nThere were no prisons, no slums, no insane asylums, no cripples, no\r\npoverty, no wars.\r\n\r\nAll diseases were conquered. So was old age.\r\n\r\nDeath, barring accidents, was an adventure for volunteers.\r\n\r\nThe population of the United States was stabilized at forty-million\r\nsouls.\r\n\r\nOne bright morning in the Chicago Lying-in Hospital, a man named Edward\r\nK. Wehling, Jr., waited for his wife to give birth. He was the only man\r\nwaiting. Not many people were born a day any more.\r\n\r\nWehling was fifty-six, a mere stripling in a population whose average\r\nage was one hundred and twenty-nine.\r\n\r\nX-rays had revealed that his wife was going to have triplets. The\r\nchildren would be his first.\r\n\r\nYoung Wehling was hunched in his chair, his head in his hand. He was so\r\nrumpled, so still and colorless as to be virtually invisible. His\r\ncamouflage was perfect, since the waiting room had a disorderly and\r\ndemoralized air, too. Chairs and ashtrays had been moved away from the\r\nwalls. The floor was paved with spattered dropcloths.\r\n\r\nThe room was being redecorated. It was being redecorated as a memorial\r\nto a man who had volunteered to die.\r\n\r\nA sardonic old man, about two hundred years old, sat on a stepladder,\r\npainting a mural he did not like. Back in the days when people aged\r\nvisibly, his age would have been guessed at thirty-five or so. Aging had\r\ntouched him that much before the cure for aging was found.\r\n\r\nThe mural he was working on depicted a very neat garden. Men and women\r\nin white, doctors and nurses, turned the soil, planted seedlings,\r\nsprayed bugs, spread fertilizer.\r\n\r\nMen and women in purple uniforms pulled up weeds, cut down plants that\r\nwere old and sickly, raked leaves, carried refuse to trash-burners.\r\n\r\nNever, never, never--not even in medieval Holland nor old Japan--had a\r\ngarden been more formal, been better tended. Every plant had all the\r\nloam, light, water, air and nourishment it could use.\r\n\r\nA hospital orderly came down the corridor, singing under his breath a\r\npopular song:\r\n\r\n     If you don't like my kisses, honey,\r\n     Here's what I will do:\r\n     I'll go see a girl in purple,\r\n     Kiss this sad world toodle-oo.\r\n     If you don't want my lovin',\r\n     Why should I take up all this space?\r\n     I'll get off this old planet,\r\n     Let some sweet baby have my place.\r\n\r\nThe orderly looked in at the mural and the muralist. \"Looks so real,\"\r\nhe said, \"I can practically imagine I'm standing in the middle of it.\"\r\n\r\n\"What makes you think you're not in it?\" said the painter. He gave a\r\nsatiric smile. \"It's called 'The Happy Garden of Life,' you know.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's good of Dr. Hitz,\" said the orderly.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHe was referring to one of the male figures in white, whose head was a\r\nportrait of Dr. Benjamin Hitz, the hospital's Chief Obstetrician. Hitz\r\nwas a blindingly handsome man.\r\n\r\n\"Lot of faces still to fill in,\" said the orderly. He meant that the\r\nfaces of many of the figures in the mural were still blank. All blanks\r\nwere to be filled with portraits of important people on either the\r\nhospital staff or from the Chicago Office of the Federal Bureau of\r\nTermination.\r\n\r\n\"Must be nice to be able to make pictures that look like something,\"\r\nsaid the orderly.\r\n\r\nThe painter's face curdled with scorn. \"You think I'm proud of this\r\ndaub?\" he said. \"You think this is my idea of what life really looks\r\nlike?\"\r\n\r\n\"What's your idea of what life looks like?\" said the orderly.\r\n\r\nThe painter gestured at a foul dropcloth. \"There's a good picture of\r\nit,\" he said. \"Frame that, and you'll have a picture a damn sight more\r\nhonest than this one.\"\r\n\r\n\"You're a gloomy old duck, aren't you?\" said the orderly.\r\n\r\n\"Is that a crime?\" said the painter.\r\n\r\nThe orderly shrugged. \"If you don't like it here, Grandpa--\" he said,\r\nand he finished the thought with the trick telephone number that people\r\nwho didn't want to live any more were supposed to call. The zero in the\r\ntelephone number he pronounced \"naught.\"\r\n\r\nThe number was: \"2 B R 0 2 B.\"\r\n\r\nIt was the telephone number of an institution whose fanciful sobriquets\r\nincluded: \"Automat,\" \"Birdland,\" \"Cannery,\" \"Catbox,\" \"De-louser,\"\r\n\"Easy-go,\" \"Good-by, Mother,\" \"Happy Hooligan,\" \"Kiss-me-quick,\" \"Lucky\r\nPierre,\" \"Sheepdip,\" \"Waring Blendor,\" \"Weep-no-more\" and \"Why Worry?\"\r\n\r\n\"To be or not to be\" was the telephone number of the municipal gas\r\nchambers of the Federal Bureau of Termination.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe painter thumbed his nose at the orderly. \"When I decide it's time to\r\ngo,\" he said, \"it won't be at the Sheepdip.\"\r\n\r\n\"A do-it-yourselfer, eh?\" said the orderly. \"Messy business, Grandpa.\r\nWhy don't you have a little consideration for the people who have to\r\nclean up after you?\"\r\n\r\nThe painter expressed with an obscenity his lack of concern for the\r\ntribulations of his survivors. \"The world could do with a good deal more\r\nmess, if you ask me,\" he said.\r\n\r\nThe orderly laughed and moved on.\r\n\r\nWehling, the waiting father, mumbled something without raising his head.\r\nAnd then he fell silent again.\r\n\r\nA coarse, formidable woman strode into the waiting room on spike heels.\r\nHer shoes, stockings, trench coat, bag and overseas cap were all purple,\r\nthe purple the painter called \"the color of grapes on Judgment Day.\"\r\n\r\nThe medallion on her purple musette bag was the seal of the Service\r\nDivision of the Federal Bureau of Termination, an eagle perched on a\r\nturnstile.\r\n\r\nThe woman had a lot of facial hair--an unmistakable mustache, in fact. A\r\ncurious thing about gas-chamber hostesses was that, no matter how lovely\r\nand feminine they were when recruited, they all sprouted mustaches\r\nwithin five years or so.\r\n\r\n\"Is this where I'm supposed to come?\" she said to the painter.\r\n\r\n\"A lot would depend on what your business was,\" he said. \"You aren't\r\nabout to have a baby, are you?\"\r\n\r\n\"They told me I was supposed to pose for some picture,\" she said. \"My\r\nname's Leora Duncan.\" She waited.\r\n\r\n\"And you dunk people,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"What?\" she said.\r\n\r\n\"Skip it,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"That sure is a beautiful picture,\" she said. \"Looks just like heaven or\r\nsomething.\"\r\n\r\n\"Or something,\" said the painter. He took a list of names from his smock\r\npocket. \"Duncan, Duncan, Duncan,\" he said, scanning the list. \"Yes--here\r\nyou are. You're entitled to be immortalized. See any faceless body here\r\nyou'd like me to stick your head on? We've got a few choice ones left.\"\r\n\r\nShe studied the mural bleakly. \"Gee,\" she said, \"they're all the same to\r\nme. I don't know anything about art.\"\r\n\r\n\"A body's a body, eh?\" he said. \"All righty. As a master of fine art, I\r\nrecommend this body here.\" He indicated a faceless figure of a woman who\r\nwas carrying dried stalks to a trash-burner.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said Leora Duncan, \"that's more the disposal people, isn't it? I\r\nmean, I'm in service. I don't do any disposing.\"\r\n\r\nThe painter clapped his hands in mock delight. \"You say you don't know\r\nanything about art, and then you prove in the next breath that you know\r\nmore about it than I do! Of course the sheave-carrier is wrong for a\r\nhostess! A snipper, a pruner--that's more your line.\" He pointed to a\r\nfigure in purple who was sawing a dead branch from an apple tree. \"How\r\nabout her?\" he said. \"You like her at all?\"\r\n\r\n\"Gosh--\" she said, and she blushed and became humble--\"that--that puts\r\nme right next to Dr. Hitz.\"\r\n\r\n\"That upsets you?\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"Good gravy, no!\" she said. \"It's--it's just such an honor.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, You... you admire him, eh?\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"Who doesn't admire him?\" she said, worshiping the portrait of Hitz. It\r\nwas the portrait of a tanned, white-haired, omnipotent Zeus, two hundred\r\nand forty years old. \"Who doesn't admire him?\" she said again. \"He was\r\nresponsible for setting up the very first gas chamber in Chicago.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nothing would please me more,\" said the painter, \"than to put you next\r\nto him for all time. Sawing off a limb--that strikes you as\r\nappropriate?\"\r\n\r\n\"That is kind of like what I do,\" she said. She was demure about what\r\nshe did. What she did was make people comfortable while she killed them.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAnd, while Leora Duncan was posing for her portrait, into the\r\nwaitingroom bounded Dr. Hitz himself. He was seven feet tall, and he\r\nboomed with importance, accomplishments, and the joy of living.\r\n\r\n\"Well, Miss Duncan! Miss Duncan!\" he said, and he made a joke. \"What\r\nare you doing here?\" he said. \"This isn't where the people leave. This\r\nis where they come in!\"\r\n\r\n\"We're going to be in the same picture together,\" she said shyly.\r\n\r\n\"Good!\" said Dr. Hitz heartily. \"And, say, isn't that some picture?\"\r\n\r\n\"I sure am honored to be in it with you,\" she said.\r\n\r\n\"Let me tell you,\" he said, \"I'm honored to be in it with you. Without\r\nwomen like you, this wonderful world we've got wouldn't be possible.\"\r\n\r\nHe saluted her and moved toward the door that led to the delivery rooms.\r\n\"Guess what was just born,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"I can't,\" she said.\r\n\r\n\"Triplets!\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"Triplets!\" she said. She was exclaiming over the legal implications of\r\ntriplets.\r\n\r\nThe law said that no newborn child could survive unless the parents of\r\nthe child could find someone who would volunteer to die. Triplets, if\r\nthey were all to live, called for three volunteers.\r\n\r\n\"Do the parents have three volunteers?\" said Leora Duncan.\r\n\r\n\"Last I heard,\" said Dr. Hitz, \"they had one, and were trying to scrape\r\nanother two up.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't think they made it,\" she said. \"Nobody made three appointments\r\nwith us. Nothing but singles going through today, unless somebody\r\ncalled in after I left. What's the name?\"\r\n\r\n\"Wehling,\" said the waiting father, sitting up, red-eyed and frowzy.\r\n\"Edward K. Wehling, Jr., is the name of the happy father-to-be.\"\r\n\r\nHe raised his right hand, looked at a spot on the wall, gave a hoarsely\r\nwretched chuckle. \"Present,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Mr. Wehling,\" said Dr. Hitz, \"I didn't see you.\"\r\n\r\n\"The invisible man,\" said Wehling.\r\n\r\n\"They just phoned me that your triplets have been born,\" said Dr. Hitz.\r\n\"They're all fine, and so is the mother. I'm on my way in to see them\r\nnow.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hooray,\" said Wehling emptily.\r\n\r\n\"You don't sound very happy,\" said Dr. Hitz.\r\n\r\n\"What man in my shoes wouldn't be happy?\" said Wehling. He gestured with\r\nhis hands to symbolize care-free simplicity. \"All I have to do is pick\r\nout which one of the triplets is going to live, then deliver my maternal\r\ngrandfather to the Happy Hooligan, and come back here with a receipt.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDr. Hitz became rather severe with Wehling, towered over him. \"You don't\r\nbelieve in population control, Mr. Wehling?\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"I think it's perfectly keen,\" said Wehling tautly.\r\n\r\n\"Would you like to go back to the good old days, when the population of\r\nthe Earth was twenty billion--about to become forty billion, then eighty\r\nbillion, then one hundred and sixty billion? Do you know what a drupelet\r\nis, Mr. Wehling?\" said Hitz.\r\n\r\n\"Nope,\" said Wehling sulkily.\r\n\r\n\"A drupelet, Mr. Wehling, is one of the little knobs, one of the little\r\npulpy grains of a blackberry,\" said Dr. Hitz. \"Without population\r\ncontrol, human beings would now be packed on this surface of this old\r\nplanet like drupelets on a blackberry! Think of it!\"\r\n\r\nWehling continued to stare at the same spot on the wall.\r\n\r\n\"In the year 2000,\" said Dr. Hitz, \"before scientists stepped in and\r\nlaid down the law, there wasn't even enough drinking water to go around,\r\nand nothing to eat but sea-weed--and still people insisted on their\r\nright to reproduce like jackrabbits. And their right, if possible, to\r\nlive forever.\"\r\n\r\n\"I want those kids,\" said Wehling quietly. \"I want all three of them.\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course you do,\" said Dr. Hitz. \"That's only human.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't want my grandfather to die, either,\" said Wehling.\r\n\r\n\"Nobody's really happy about taking a close relative to the Catbox,\"\r\nsaid Dr. Hitz gently, sympathetically.\r\n\r\n\"I wish people wouldn't call it that,\" said Leora Duncan.\r\n\r\n\"What?\" said Dr. Hitz.\r\n\r\n\"I wish people wouldn't call it 'the Catbox,' and things like that,\" she\r\nsaid. \"It gives people the wrong impression.\"\r\n\r\n\"You're absolutely right,\" said Dr. Hitz. \"Forgive me.\" He corrected\r\nhimself, gave the municipal gas chambers their official title, a title\r\nno one ever used in conversation. \"I should have said, 'Ethical Suicide\r\nStudios,'\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"That sounds so much better,\" said Leora Duncan.\r\n\r\n\"This child of yours--whichever one you decide to keep, Mr. Wehling,\"\r\nsaid Dr. Hitz. \"He or she is going to live on a happy, roomy, clean,\r\nrich planet, thanks to population control. In a garden like that mural\r\nthere.\" He shook his head. \"Two centuries ago, when I was a young man,\r\nit was a hell that nobody thought could last another twenty years. Now\r\ncenturies of peace and plenty stretch before us as far as the\r\nimagination cares to travel.\"\r\n\r\nHe smiled luminously.\r\n\r\nThe smile faded as he saw that Wehling had just drawn a revolver.\r\n\r\nWehling shot Dr. Hitz dead. \"There's room for one--a great big one,\" he\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\nAnd then he shot Leora Duncan. \"It's only death,\" he said to her as she\r\nfell. \"There! Room for two.\"\r\n\r\nAnd then he shot himself, making room for all three of his children.\r\n\r\nNobody came running. Nobody, seemingly, heard the shots.\r\n\r\nThe painter sat on the top of his stepladder, looking down reflectively\r\non the sorry scene.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe painter pondered the mournful puzzle of life demanding to be born\r\nand, once born, demanding to be fruitful ... to multiply and to live as\r\nlong as possible--to do all that on a very small planet that would have\r\nto last forever.\r\n\r\nAll the answers that the painter could think of were grim. Even grimmer,\r\nsurely, than a Catbox, a Happy Hooligan, an Easy Go. He thought of war.\r\nHe thought of plague. He thought of starvation.\r\n\r\nHe knew that he would never paint again. He let his paintbrush fall to\r\nthe dropcloths below. And then he decided he had had about enough of\r\nlife in the Happy Garden of Life, too, and he came slowly down from the\r\nladder.\r\n\r\nHe took Wehling's pistol, really intending to shoot himself.\r\n\r\nBut he didn't have the nerve.\r\n\r\nAnd then he saw the telephone booth in the corner of the room. He went\r\nto it, dialed the well-remembered number: \"2 B R 0 2 B.\"\r\n\r\n\"Federal Bureau of Termination,\" said the very warm voice of a hostess.\r\n\r\n\"How soon could I get an appointment?\" he asked, speaking very\r\ncarefully.\r\n\r\n\"We could probably fit you in late this afternoon, sir,\" she said. \"It\r\nmight even be earlier, if we get a cancellation.\"\r\n\r\n\"All right,\" said the painter, \"fit me in, if you please.\" And he gave\r\nher his name, spelling it out.\r\n\r\n\"Thank you, sir,\" said the hostess. \"Your city thanks you; your country\r\nthanks you; your planet thanks you. But the deepest thanks of all is\r\nfrom future generations.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nEND"

    "content": "An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge\r\n\r\nby Ambrose Bierce\r\n\r\nTHE MILLENNIUM FULCRUM EDITION, 1988\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\n\r\nA man stood upon a railroad bridge in northern Alabama, looking down\r\ninto the swift water twenty feet below. The man’s hands were behind his\r\nback, the wrists bound with a cord. A rope closely encircled his neck.\r\nIt was attached to a stout cross-timber above his head and the slack\r\nfell to the level of his knees. Some loose boards laid upon the ties\r\nsupporting the rails of the railway supplied a footing for him and his\r\nexecutioners—two private soldiers of the Federal army, directed by a\r\nsergeant who in civil life may have been a deputy sheriff. At a short\r\nremove upon the same temporary platform was an officer in the uniform\r\nof his rank, armed. He was a captain. A sentinel at each end of the\r\nbridge stood with his rifle in the position known as “support,” that is\r\nto say, vertical in front of the left shoulder, the hammer resting on\r\nthe forearm thrown straight across the chest—a formal and unnatural\r\nposition, enforcing an erect carriage of the body. It did not appear to\r\nbe the duty of these two men to know what was occurring at the center\r\nof the bridge; they merely blockaded the two ends of the foot planking\r\nthat traversed it.\r\n\r\nBeyond one of the sentinels nobody was in sight; the railroad ran\r\nstraight away into a forest for a hundred yards, then, curving, was\r\nlost to view. Doubtless there was an outpost farther along. The other\r\nbank of the stream was open ground—a gentle slope topped with a\r\nstockade of vertical tree trunks, loopholed for rifles, with a single\r\nembrasure through which protruded the muzzle of a brass cannon\r\ncommanding the bridge. Midway up the slope between the bridge and fort\r\nwere the spectators—a single company of infantry in line, at “parade\r\nrest,” the butts of their rifles on the ground, the barrels inclining\r\nslightly backward against the right shoulder, the hands crossed upon\r\nthe stock. A lieutenant stood at the right of the line, the point of\r\nhis sword upon the ground, his left hand resting upon his right.\r\nExcepting the group of four at the center of the bridge, not a man\r\nmoved. The company faced the bridge, staring stonily, motionless. The\r\nsentinels, facing the banks of the stream, might have been statues to\r\nadorn the bridge. The captain stood with folded arms, silent, observing\r\nthe work of his subordinates, but making no sign. Death is a dignitary\r\nwho when he comes announced is to be received with formal\r\nmanifestations of respect, even by those most familiar with him. In the\r\ncode of military etiquette silence and fixity are forms of deference.\r\n\r\nThe man who was engaged in being hanged was apparently about\r\nthirty-five years of age. He was a civilian, if one might judge from\r\nhis habit, which was that of a planter. His features were good—a\r\nstraight nose, firm mouth, broad forehead, from which his long, dark\r\nhair was combed straight back, falling behind his ears to the collar of\r\nhis well fitting frock coat. He wore a moustache and pointed beard, but\r\nno whiskers; his eyes were large and dark gray, and had a kindly\r\nexpression which one would hardly have expected in one whose neck was\r\nin the hemp. Evidently this was no vulgar assassin. The liberal\r\nmilitary code makes provision for hanging many kinds of persons, and\r\ngentlemen are not excluded.\r\n\r\nThe preparations being complete, the two private soldiers stepped aside\r\nand each drew away the plank upon which he had been standing. The\r\nsergeant turned to the captain, saluted and placed himself immediately\r\nbehind that officer, who in turn moved apart one pace. These movements\r\nleft the condemned man and the sergeant standing on the two ends of the\r\nsame plank, which spanned three of the cross-ties of the bridge. The\r\nend upon which the civilian stood almost, but not quite, reached a\r\nfourth. This plank had been held in place by the weight of the captain;\r\nit was now held by that of the sergeant. At a signal from the former\r\nthe latter would step aside, the plank would tilt and the condemned man\r\ngo down between two ties. The arrangement commended itself to his\r\njudgement as simple and effective. His face had not been covered nor\r\nhis eyes bandaged. He looked a moment at his “unsteadfast footing,”\r\nthen let his gaze wander to the swirling water of the stream racing\r\nmadly beneath his feet. A piece of dancing driftwood caught his\r\nattention and his eyes followed it down the current. How slowly it\r\nappeared to move! What a sluggish stream!\r\n\r\nHe closed his eyes in order to fix his last thoughts upon his wife and\r\nchildren. The water, touched to gold by the early sun, the brooding\r\nmists under the banks at some distance down the stream, the fort, the\r\nsoldiers, the piece of drift—all had distracted him. And now he became\r\nconscious of a new disturbance. Striking through the thought of his\r\ndear ones was sound which he could neither ignore nor understand, a\r\nsharp, distinct, metallic percussion like the stroke of a blacksmith’s\r\nhammer upon the anvil; it had the same ringing quality. He wondered\r\nwhat it was, and whether immeasurably distant or near by— it seemed\r\nboth. Its recurrence was regular, but as slow as the tolling of a death\r\nknell. He awaited each new stroke with impatience and—he knew not\r\nwhy—apprehension. The intervals of silence grew progressively longer;\r\nthe delays became maddening. With their greater infrequency the sounds\r\nincreased in strength and sharpness. They hurt his ear like the thrust\r\nof a knife; he feared he would shriek. What he heard was the ticking of\r\nhis watch.\r\n\r\nHe unclosed his eyes and saw again the water below him. “If I could\r\nfree my hands,” he thought, “I might throw off the noose and spring\r\ninto the stream. By diving I could evade the bullets and, swimming\r\nvigorously, reach the bank, take to the woods and get away home. My\r\nhome, thank God, is as yet outside their lines; my wife and little ones\r\nare still beyond the invader’s farthest advance.”\r\n\r\nAs these thoughts, which have here to be set down in words, were\r\nflashed into the doomed man’s brain rather than evolved from it the\r\ncaptain nodded to the sergeant. The sergeant stepped aside.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\n\r\nPeyton Farquhar was a well to do planter, of an old and highly\r\nrespected Alabama family. Being a slave owner and like other slave\r\nowners a politician, he was naturally an original secessionist and\r\nardently devoted to the Southern cause. Circumstances of an imperious\r\nnature, which it is unnecessary to relate here, had prevented him from\r\ntaking service with that gallant army which had fought the disastrous\r\ncampaigns ending with the fall of Corinth, and he chafed under the\r\ninglorious restraint, longing for the release of his energies, the\r\nlarger life of the soldier, the opportunity for distinction. That\r\nopportunity, he felt, would come, as it comes to all in wartime.\r\nMeanwhile he did what he could. No service was too humble for him to\r\nperform in the aid of the South, no adventure too perilous for him to\r\nundertake if consistent with the character of a civilian who was at\r\nheart a soldier, and who in good faith and without too much\r\nqualification assented to at least a part of the frankly villainous\r\ndictum that all is fair in love and war.\r\n\r\nOne evening while Farquhar and his wife were sitting on a rustic bench\r\nnear the entrance to his grounds, a gray-clad soldier rode up to the\r\ngate and asked for a drink of water. Mrs. Farquhar was only too happy\r\nto serve him with her own white hands. While she was fetching the water\r\nher husband approached the dusty horseman and inquired eagerly for news\r\nfrom the front.\r\n\r\n“The Yanks are repairing the railroads,” said the man, “and are getting\r\nready for another advance. They have reached the Owl Creek bridge, put\r\nit in order and built a stockade on the north bank. The commandant has\r\nissued an order, which is posted everywhere, declaring that any\r\ncivilian caught interfering with the railroad, its bridges, tunnels, or\r\ntrains will be summarily hanged. I saw the order.”\r\n\r\n“How far is it to the Owl Creek bridge?” Farquhar asked.\r\n\r\n“About thirty miles.”\r\n\r\n“Is there no force on this side of the creek?”\r\n\r\n“Only a picket post half a mile out, on the railroad, and a single\r\nsentinel at this end of the bridge.”\r\n\r\n“Suppose a man—a civilian and student of hanging—should elude the\r\npicket post and perhaps get the better of the sentinel,” said Farquhar,\r\nsmiling, “what could he accomplish?”\r\n\r\nThe soldier reflected. “I was there a month ago,” he replied. “I\r\nobserved that the flood of last winter had lodged a great quantity of\r\ndriftwood against the wooden pier at this end of the bridge. It is now\r\ndry and would burn like tinder.”\r\n\r\nThe lady had now brought the water, which the soldier drank. He thanked\r\nher ceremoniously, bowed to her husband and rode away. An hour later,\r\nafter nightfall, he repassed the plantation, going northward in the\r\ndirection from which he had come. He was a Federal scout.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\n\r\nAs Peyton Farquhar fell straight downward through the bridge he lost\r\nconsciousness and was as one already dead. From this state he was\r\nawakened—ages later, it seemed to him—by the pain of a sharp pressure\r\nupon his throat, followed by a sense of suffocation. Keen, poignant\r\nagonies seemed to shoot from his neck downward through every fiber of\r\nhis body and limbs. These pains appeared to flash along well defined\r\nlines of ramification and to beat with an inconceivably rapid\r\nperiodicity. They seemed like streams of pulsating fire heating him to\r\nan intolerable temperature. As to his head, he was conscious of nothing\r\nbut a feeling of fullness—of congestion. These sensations were\r\nunaccompanied by thought. The intellectual part of his nature was\r\nalready effaced; he had power only to feel, and feeling was torment. He\r\nwas conscious of motion. Encompassed in a luminous cloud, of which he\r\nwas now merely the fiery heart, without material substance, he swung\r\nthrough unthinkable arcs of oscillation, like a vast pendulum. Then all\r\nat once, with terrible suddenness, the light about him shot upward with\r\nthe noise of a loud splash; a frightful roaring was in his ears, and\r\nall was cold and dark. The power of thought was restored; he knew that\r\nthe rope had broken and he had fallen into the stream. There was no\r\nadditional strangulation; the noose about his neck was already\r\nsuffocating him and kept the water from his lungs. To die of hanging at\r\nthe bottom of a river!—the idea seemed to him ludicrous. He opened his\r\neyes in the darkness and saw above him a gleam of light, but how\r\ndistant, how inaccessible! He was still sinking, for the light became\r\nfainter and fainter until it was a mere glimmer. Then it began to grow\r\nand brighten, and he knew that he was rising toward the surface—knew it\r\nwith reluctance, for he was now very comfortable. “To be hanged and\r\ndrowned,” he thought, “that is not so bad; but I do not wish to be\r\nshot. No; I will not be shot; that is not fair.”\r\n\r\nHe was not conscious of an effort, but a sharp pain in his wrist\r\napprised him that he was trying to free his hands. He gave the struggle\r\nhis attention, as an idler might observe the feat of a juggler, without\r\ninterest in the outcome. What splendid effort!—what magnificent, what\r\nsuperhuman strength! Ah, that was a fine endeavor! Bravo! The cord fell\r\naway; his arms parted and floated upward, the hands dimly seen on each\r\nside in the growing light. He watched them with a new interest as first\r\none and then the other pounced upon the noose at his neck. They tore it\r\naway and thrust it fiercely aside, its undulations resembling those of\r\na water snake. “Put it back, put it back!” He thought he shouted these\r\nwords to his hands, for the undoing of the noose had been succeeded by\r\nthe direst pang that he had yet experienced. His neck ached horribly;\r\nhis brain was on fire, his heart, which had been fluttering faintly,\r\ngave a great leap, trying to force itself out at his mouth. His whole\r\nbody was racked and wrenched with an insupportable anguish! But his\r\ndisobedient hands gave no heed to the command. They beat the water\r\nvigorously with quick, downward strokes, forcing him to the surface. He\r\nfelt his head emerge; his eyes were blinded by the sunlight; his chest\r\nexpanded convulsively, and with a supreme and crowning agony his lungs\r\nengulfed a great draught of air, which instantly he expelled in a\r\nshriek!\r\n\r\nHe was now in full possession of his physical senses. They were,\r\nindeed, preternaturally keen and alert. Something in the awful\r\ndisturbance of his organic system had so exalted and refined them that\r\nthey made record of things never before perceived. He felt the ripples\r\nupon his face and heard their separate sounds as they struck. He looked\r\nat the forest on the bank of the stream, saw the individual trees, the\r\nleaves and the veining of each leaf—he saw the very insects upon them:\r\nthe locusts, the brilliant bodied flies, the gray spiders stretching\r\ntheir webs from twig to twig. He noted the prismatic colors in all the\r\ndewdrops upon a million blades of grass. The humming of the gnats that\r\ndanced above the eddies of the stream, the beating of the dragon flies’\r\nwings, the strokes of the water spiders’ legs, like oars which had\r\nlifted their boat—all these made audible music. A fish slid along\r\nbeneath his eyes and he heard the rush of its body parting the water.\r\n\r\nHe had come to the surface facing down the stream; in a moment the\r\nvisible world seemed to wheel slowly round, himself the pivotal point,\r\nand he saw the bridge, the fort, the soldiers upon the bridge, the\r\ncaptain, the sergeant, the two privates, his executioners. They were in\r\nsilhouette against the blue sky. They shouted and gesticulated,\r\npointing at him. The captain had drawn his pistol, but did not fire;\r\nthe others were unarmed. Their movements were grotesque and horrible,\r\ntheir forms gigantic.\r\n\r\nSuddenly he heard a sharp report and something struck the water smartly\r\nwithin a few inches of his head, spattering his face with spray. He\r\nheard a second report, and saw one of the sentinels with his rifle at\r\nhis shoulder, a light cloud of blue smoke rising from the muzzle. The\r\nman in the water saw the eye of the man on the bridge gazing into his\r\nown through the sights of the rifle. He observed that it was a gray eye\r\nand remembered having read that gray eyes were keenest, and that all\r\nfamous marksmen had them. Nevertheless, this one had missed.\r\n\r\nA counter-swirl had caught Farquhar and turned him half round; he was\r\nagain looking at the forest on the bank opposite the fort. The sound of\r\na clear, high voice in a monotonous singsong now rang out behind him\r\nand came across the water with a distinctness that pierced and subdued\r\nall other sounds, even the beating of the ripples in his ears. Although\r\nno soldier, he had frequented camps enough to know the dread\r\nsignificance of that deliberate, drawling, aspirated chant; the\r\nlieutenant on shore was taking a part in the morning’s work. How coldly\r\nand pitilessly—with what an even, calm intonation, presaging, and\r\nenforcing tranquility in the men—with what accurately measured interval\r\nfell those cruel words:\r\n\r\n“Company!… Attention!… Shoulder arms!… Ready!… Aim!… Fire!”\r\n\r\nFarquhar dived—dived as deeply as he could. The water roared in his\r\nears like the voice of Niagara, yet he heard the dull thunder of the\r\nvolley and, rising again toward the surface, met shining bits of metal,\r\nsingularly flattened, oscillating slowly downward. Some of them touched\r\nhim on the face and hands, then fell away, continuing their descent.\r\nOne lodged between his collar and neck; it was uncomfortably warm and\r\nhe snatched it out.\r\n\r\nAs he rose to the surface, gasping for breath, he saw that he had been\r\na long time under water; he was perceptibly farther downstream—nearer\r\nto safety. The soldiers had almost finished reloading; the metal\r\nramrods flashed all at once in the sunshine as they were drawn from the\r\nbarrels, turned in the air, and thrust into their sockets. The two\r\nsentinels fired again, independently and ineffectually.\r\n\r\nThe hunted man saw all this over his shoulder; he was now swimming\r\nvigorously with the current. His brain was as energetic as his arms and\r\nlegs; he thought with the rapidity of lightning:\r\n\r\n“The officer,” he reasoned, “will not make that martinet’s error a\r\nsecond time. It is as easy to dodge a volley as a single shot. He has\r\nprobably already given the command to fire at will. God help me, I\r\ncannot dodge them all!”\r\n\r\nAn appalling splash within two yards of him was followed by a loud,\r\nrushing sound, DIMINUENDO, which seemed to travel back through the air\r\nto the fort and died in an explosion which stirred the very river to\r\nits deeps! A rising sheet of water curved over him, fell down upon him,\r\nblinded him, strangled him! The cannon had taken an hand in the game.\r\nAs he shook his head free from the commotion of the smitten water he\r\nheard the deflected shot humming through the air ahead, and in an\r\ninstant it was cracking and smashing the branches in the forest beyond.\r\n\r\n“They will not do that again,” he thought; “the next time they will use\r\na charge of grape. I must keep my eye upon the gun; the smoke will\r\napprise me—the report arrives too late; it lags behind the missile.\r\nThat is a good gun.”\r\n\r\nSuddenly he felt himself whirled round and round—spinning like a top.\r\nThe water, the banks, the forests, the now distant bridge, fort and\r\nmen, all were commingled and blurred. Objects were represented by their\r\ncolors only; circular horizontal streaks of color—that was all he saw.\r\nHe had been caught in a vortex and was being whirled on with a velocity\r\nof advance and gyration that made him giddy and sick. In few moments he\r\nwas flung upon the gravel at the foot of the left bank of the\r\nstream—the southern bank—and behind a projecting point which concealed\r\nhim from his enemies. The sudden arrest of his motion, the abrasion of\r\none of his hands on the gravel, restored him, and he wept with delight.\r\nHe dug his fingers into the sand, threw it over himself in handfuls and\r\naudibly blessed it. It looked like diamonds, rubies, emeralds; he could\r\nthink of nothing beautiful which it did not resemble. The trees upon\r\nthe bank were giant garden plants; he noted a definite order in their\r\narrangement, inhaled the fragrance of their blooms. A strange roseate\r\nlight shone through the spaces among their trunks and the wind made in\r\ntheir branches the music of AEolian harps. He had not wish to perfect\r\nhis escape—he was content to remain in that enchanting spot until\r\nretaken.\r\n\r\nA whiz and a rattle of grapeshot among the branches high above his head\r\nroused him from his dream. The baffled cannoneer had fired him a random\r\nfarewell. He sprang to his feet, rushed up the sloping bank, and\r\nplunged into the forest.\r\n\r\nAll that day he traveled, laying his course by the rounding sun. The\r\nforest seemed interminable; nowhere did he discover a break in it, not\r\neven a woodman’s road. He had not known that he lived in so wild a\r\nregion. There was something uncanny in the revelation.\r\n\r\nBy nightfall he was fatigued, footsore, famished. The thought of his\r\nwife and children urged him on. At last he found a road which led him\r\nin what he knew to be the right direction. It was as wide and straight\r\nas a city street, yet it seemed untraveled. No fields bordered it, no\r\ndwelling anywhere. Not so much as the barking of a dog suggested human\r\nhabitation. The black bodies of the trees formed a straight wall on\r\nboth sides, terminating on the horizon in a point, like a diagram in a\r\nlesson in perspective. Overhead, as he looked up through this rift in\r\nthe wood, shone great golden stars looking unfamiliar and grouped in\r\nstrange constellations. He was sure they were arranged in some order\r\nwhich had a secret and malign significance. The wood on either side was\r\nfull of singular noises, among which—once, twice, and again—he\r\ndistinctly heard whispers in an unknown tongue.\r\n\r\nHis neck was in pain and lifting his hand to it found it horribly\r\nswollen. He knew that it had a circle of black where the rope had\r\nbruised it. His eyes felt congested; he could no longer close them. His\r\ntongue was swollen with thirst; he relieved its fever by thrusting it\r\nforward from between his teeth into the cold air. How softly the turf\r\nhad carpeted the untraveled avenue—he could no longer feel the roadway\r\nbeneath his feet!\r\n\r\nDoubtless, despite his suffering, he had fallen asleep while walking,\r\nfor now he sees another scene—perhaps he has merely recovered from a\r\ndelirium. He stands at the gate of his own home. All is as he left it,\r\nand all bright and beautiful in the morning sunshine. He must have\r\ntraveled the entire night. As he pushes open the gate and passes up the\r\nwide white walk, he sees a flutter of female garments; his wife,\r\nlooking fresh and cool and sweet, steps down from the veranda to meet\r\nhim. At the bottom of the steps she stands waiting, with a smile of\r\nineffable joy, an attitude of matchless grace and dignity. Ah, how\r\nbeautiful she is! He springs forwards with extended arms. As he is\r\nabout to clasp her he feels a stunning blow upon the back of the neck;\r\na blinding white light blazes all about him with a sound like the shock\r\nof a cannon—then all is darkness and silence!\r\n\r\nPeyton Farquhar was dead; his body, with a broken neck, swung gently\r\nfrom side to side beneath the timbers of the Owl Creek bridge."

Poirot had received a\r\nbrisk and businesslike note from the lady asking for an appointment,\r\nand he had replied, asking her to call upon him at eleven o’clock the\r\nfollowing day.\r\n\r\nShe arrived punctually—a tall, handsome young woman, plainly but\r\nneatly dressed, with an assured and businesslike manner—clearly, a\r\nyoung woman who meant to get on in the world. I am not a great admirer\r\nof the so-called New Woman myself, and in spite of her good looks, I\r\nwas not particularly prepossessed in her favor.\r\n\r\n“My business is of a somewhat unusual nature, M. Poirot,” she began,\r\nafter she had accepted a chair. “I had better begin at the beginning\r\nand tell you the whole story.”\r\n\r\n“If you please, mademoiselle.”\r\n\r\n“I am an orphan. My father was one of two brothers, sons of a small\r\nyeoman farmer in Devonshire. The farm was a poor one, and the eldest\r\nbrother, Andrew, emigrated to Australia, where he did very well\r\nindeed, and by means of successful speculation in land became a very\r\nrich man. The younger brother, Roger, my father, had no leanings\r\ntoward the agricultural life. He managed to educate himself a little,\r\nand obtained a post as a clerk in a small firm. He married slightly\r\nabove him; my mother was the daughter of a poor artist. My father died\r\nwhen I was six years old. When I was fourteen, my mother followed him\r\nto the grave. My only living relation then was my Uncle Andrew, who\r\nhad recently returned from Australia and bought a small place in his\r\nnative county, Crabtree Manor. He was exceedingly kind to his\r\nbrother’s orphan child, took me to live with him, and treated me in\r\nevery way as though I were his own daughter.\r\n\r\n“Crabtree Manor,” she pursued, “in spite of its name, is really only\r\nan old farmhouse. Farming was in my uncle’s blood, and he was\r\nintensely interested in various modern farming experiments. Although\r\nkindness itself to me, he had certain peculiar and deeply rooted ideas\r\nas to the upbringing of women. Himself a man of little or no\r\neducation, though possessing remarkable shrewdness, he placed little\r\nvalue on what he called ‘book knowledge.’ He was especially opposed to\r\nthe education of women. In his opinion, girls should learn practical\r\nhousework and dairy work, be useful about the home, and have as little\r\nto do with book-learning as possible. He proposed to bring me up on\r\nthese lines, to my bitter disappointment.\r\n\r\n“I rebelled frankly. I knew that I possessed a good brain, and had\r\nabsolutely no talent for domestic duties. My uncle and I had many\r\nbitter arguments on the subject, for though much attached to each\r\nother, we were both self-willed. I was lucky enough to win a\r\nscholarship, and up to a certain point was successful in getting my\r\nown way. The crisis arose when I resolved to go to Girton. I had a\r\nlittle money of my own, left me by my mother, and I was quite\r\ndetermined to make the best use of the gifts God had given me. I had\r\none long final argument with my uncle. He put the facts plainly before\r\nme. He had no other relations, and he had intended me to be his sole\r\nheiress. As I have told you, he was a very rich man. If I persisted in\r\nthese ‘newfangled notions’ of mine, however, I need look for nothing\r\nfrom him. I remained polite, but firm. I should always be deeply\r\nattached to him, but I must lead my own life. We parted on that note.\r\n‘You fancy your brains, my girl,’ were his last words. ‘I’ve no\r\nbook-learning, but for all that, I’ll pit mine against yours any day.\r\nWe’ll see what we shall see.’\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“That was nine years ago. I have stayed with him for a week-end\r\noccasionally, and our relations were perfectly amicable, though his\r\nviews remained unaltered. He never referred to my having matriculated,\r\nnor to my B. Sc. For the last three years his health has been failing,\r\nand a month ago he died. I am now coming to the point of my visit. My\r\nuncle left a most extraordinary will. By its terms, Crabtree Manor and\r\nits contents are to be at my disposal for a year from his\r\ndeath—‘during which time my clever niece may prove her wits,’ the\r\nactual words run. At the end of that period, ‘my wits having proved\r\nbetter than hers,’ the house and all my uncle’s large fortune pass to\r\nvarious charitable institutions.”\r\n\r\n“That is a little hard on you, mademoiselle,” commented Poirot,\r\n“seeing that you were Mr. Marsh’s only blood relation.”\r\n\r\n“I do not look on it in that way. Uncle Andrew warned me fairly, and I\r\nchose my own path. Since I would not fall in with his wishes, he was\r\nat perfect liberty to leave his money to whom he pleased.”\r\n\r\n“Was the will drawn up by a lawyer?”\r\n\r\n“No; it was written on a printed will-form and witnessed by the man\r\nand his wife who lived in the house and looked after my uncle.”\r\n\r\n“There might be a possibility of upsetting such a will?”\r\n\r\n“I would not even attempt to do such a thing.”\r\n\r\n“You regard it, then, as a sporting challenge on the part of your\r\nuncle?”\r\n\r\n“That is exactly how I look upon it.”\r\n\r\n“It bears that interpretation, certainly,” said Poirot thoughtfully.\r\n“Somewhere in this rambling old manor house your uncle has concealed\r\neither a sum of money in notes, or possibly a second will, and has\r\ngiven you a year in which to exercise your ingenuity to find it.”\r\n\r\n“Exactly, M. Poirot, and I am paying you the compliment of assuming\r\nthat your ingenuity will be greater than mine.”\r\n\r\n“Eh, eh! But that is very charming of you. My gray cells are at your\r\ndisposal. You have made no search yourself?”\r\n\r\n“Only a cursory one, but I have too much respect for my uncle’s\r\nundoubted abilities to fancy that the task will be an easy one.”\r\n\r\n“Have you the will, or a copy of it with you?”\r\n\r\nMiss Marsh handed a document across the table. Poirot ran through it,\r\nnodding to himself.\r\n\r\n“Made three years ago. Dated March 25, and the time is given\r\nalso—eleven a. m.—that is very suggestive. It narrows the field of\r\nsearch. Assuredly it is another will we have to seek for. A will made\r\neven half an hour later would upset this. _Eh bien_, mademoiselle, it\r\nis a problem charming and ingenious that you have presented to me\r\nhere. I shall have all the pleasure in the world in solving it for\r\nyou. Granted that your uncle was a man of ability, his gray cells\r\ncannot have been of the quality of Hercule Poirot’s!”\r\n\r\n(Really, Poirot’s vanity is blatant!)\r\n\r\n“Fortunately, I have nothing of moment on hand at the minute. Hastings\r\nand I will go down to Crabtree Manor tonight. The man and wife who\r\nattended on your uncle are still there, I presume?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, their name is Baker.”\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe following morning saw us started on the hunt proper. We had\r\narrived late the night before. Mr. and Mrs. Baker, having received a\r\ntelegram from Miss Marsh, were expecting us. They were a pleasant\r\ncouple, the man gnarled and pink-cheeked like a shriveled pippin, and\r\nhis wife a woman of vast proportions and true Devonshire calm.\r\n\r\nTired with our journey, including an eight-mile drive from the\r\nstation, we had retired at once to bed after a supper of roast\r\nchicken, apple pie and Devonshire cream. We had now disposed of an\r\nexcellent breakfast, and were sitting in a small paneled room which\r\nhad been the late Mr. Marsh’s study and living-room. A roll-top desk\r\nstuffed with papers, all neatly docketed, stood against the wall, and\r\na big leather armchair showed plainly that it had been its owner’s\r\nconstant resting-place. A big chintz-covered settee ran along the\r\nopposite wall, and the deep low window-seats were covered with the\r\nsame faded chintz of an old-fashioned pattern.\r\n\r\n“_Eh bien, mon ami_,” said Poirot, lighting one of his tiny\r\ncigarettes, “we must map out our plan of campaign. Already I have made\r\na rough survey of the house, but I am of opinion that any clue will be\r\nfound in this room. We shall have to go through the documents in the\r\ndesk with meticulous care. Naturally I do not expect to find the will\r\namong them, but it is likely that some apparently innocent paper may\r\nconceal the clue to its hiding-place. But first we must have a little\r\ninformation. Ring the bell, I pray of you.”\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI did so. While we were waiting for it to be answered, Poirot walked\r\nup and down, looking about him approvingly.\r\n\r\n“A man of method, this Mr. Marsh. See how neatly the packets of papers\r\nare docketed; and the key to each drawer has its ivory label—so has\r\nthe key of the china-cabinet on the wall. And see with what precision\r\nthe china within is arranged! It rejoices the heart. Nothing here\r\noffends the eye—”\r\n\r\nHe came to an abrupt pause, as his eye was caught by the key of the\r\ndesk itself, to which a dirty envelope was affixed. Poirot frowned at\r\nit, and withdrew it from the lock. On it were scrawled the words “_Key\r\nof Roll-top Desk_” in a crabbed handwriting quite unlike the neat\r\nsuperscriptures on the other keys.\r\n\r\n“An alien note,” said Poirot, frowning. “I could swear that here we\r\nhave no longer the personality of Mr. Marsh. But who else has been in\r\nthe house? Only Miss Marsh; and she, if I mistake not, is also a young\r\nlady of method and order.”\r\n\r\nBaker came in answer to the bell.\r\n\r\n“Will you fetch Madame your wife and answer a few questions?”\r\n\r\nBaker departed, and in a few moments returned with Mrs. Baker, wiping\r\nher hands on her apron and beaming all over her face.\r\n\r\nIn a few clear words, Poirot set forth the object of his mission. The\r\nBakers were immediately sympathetic.\r\n\r\n“Us don’t want to see Miss Violet done out of what’s hers,” declared\r\nthe woman. “Cruel hard, ’twould be, for hospitals to get it all.”\r\n\r\nPoirot proceeded with his questions. Yes, Mr. and Mrs. Baker\r\nremembered perfectly witnessing the will. Baker had previously been\r\nsent into the neighboring town to get two printed will-forms.\r\n\r\n“Two?” said Poirot sharply.\r\n\r\n“Yes sir, for safety like, I suppose, in case he should spoil one—and\r\nsure enough, so he did do. Us had signed one—”\r\n\r\n“What time of day was that?”\r\n\r\nBaker scratched his head, but his wife was quicker.\r\n\r\n“Why, to be sure, I’d just put the milk on for the cocoa at eleven.\r\nDon’t ee remember? It had all boiled over on the stove when us got\r\nback to kitchen.”\r\n\r\n“And afterward?”\r\n\r\n“’Twould be about an hour later. Us had to go in again. ‘I’ve made a\r\nmistake,’ says old Master, ‘—had to tear the whole thing up. I’ll\r\ntrouble you to sign again.’ And us did. And afterward Master give us a\r\ntidy sum of money each. ‘I’ve left you nothing in my will,’ says he,\r\n‘but each year I live, you’ll have this to be a nest-egg when I’m\r\ngone;’ and sure enough, so he did.”\r\n\r\nPoirot reflected.\r\n\r\n“After you had signed the second time, what did Mr. Marsh do? Do you\r\nknow?”\r\n\r\n“Went out to the village to pay tradesmen’s books.”\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThat did not seem very promising. Poirot tried another tack. He held\r\nout the key of the desk.\r\n\r\n“Is that your master’s writing?”\r\n\r\nI may have imagined it, but I fancied that a moment or two elapsed\r\nbefore Baker replied: “Yes sir, it is.”\r\n\r\n“He’s lying,” I thought. “But why?”\r\n\r\n“Has your master let the house? Have there been any strangers in it\r\nduring the last three years?”\r\n\r\n“No sir.”\r\n\r\n“No visitors?”\r\n\r\n“Only Miss Violet.”\r\n\r\n“No strangers of any kind been inside this room?”\r\n\r\n“No sir.”\r\n\r\n“You forget the workmen, Jim,” his wife reminded him.\r\n\r\n“Workmen?” Poirot wheeled round on her. “What workmen?”\r\n\r\nThe woman explained that about two years and a half ago workmen had\r\nbeen in the house to do certain repairs. She was quite vague as to\r\nwhat the repairs were. Her view seemed to be that the whole thing was\r\na fad of her master’s, and quite unnecessary. Part of the time the\r\nworkmen had been in the study, but what they had done there she could\r\nnot say, as her master had not let either of them into the room while\r\nthe work was in progress. Unfortunately they could not remember the\r\nname of the firm employed, beyond the fact that it was a Plymouth one.\r\n\r\n“We progress, Hastings,” said Poirot, rubbing his hands, as the Bakers\r\nleft the room. “Clearly he made a second will, and then had workmen\r\nfrom Plymouth in to make a suitable hiding-place. Instead of wasting\r\ntime, taking up the floor and tapping the walls, we will go to\r\nPlymouth.”\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWith a little trouble we were able to get the information we wanted.\r\nAnd after one or two essays, we found the firm employed by Mr. Marsh.\r\n\r\nTheir employees had all been with them many years, and it was easy to\r\nfind the two men who had worked under Mr. Marsh’s orders. They\r\nremembered the job perfectly. Among various other minor jobs, they had\r\ntaken up one of the bricks of the old-fashioned fireplace, made a\r\ncavity beneath, and so cut the brick that it was impossible to see the\r\njoint. By pressing on the second brick from the end, the whole thing\r\nwas raised. It had been quite a complicated piece of work, and the old\r\ngentleman had been very fussy about it. Our informant was a man called\r\nCoghan, a big, gaunt man with a grizzled mustache. He seemed an\r\nintelligent fellow.\r\n\r\nWe returned to Crabtree Manor in high spirits, and locking the study\r\ndoor, proceeded to put our newly acquired knowledge into effect. It\r\nwas impossible to see any sign on the bricks, but when we pressed in\r\nthe manner indicated, a deep cavity was at once disclosed.\r\n\r\nEagerly Poirot plunged in his hand. Suddenly his face fell from\r\ncomplacent elation to consternation. All he held was a charred\r\nfragment of stiff paper. But for it, the cavity was empty.\r\n\r\n“_Sacré_,” cried Poirot angrily. “Some one has been here before us!”\r\n\r\nWe examined the scrap of paper anxiously. Clearly it was a fragment of\r\nwhat we sought. A portion of Baker’s signature remained, but no\r\nindication of what the terms of the will had been.\r\n\r\nPoirot sat back on his heels.\r\n\r\n“I understand it not,” he growled. “Who destroyed this? And what was\r\ntheir object?”\r\n\r\n“The Bakers?” I suggested.\r\n\r\n“_Pourquoi?_ Neither will makes any provision for them, and they are\r\nmore likely to be kept on with Miss Marsh than if the place became the\r\nproperty of a hospital. How could it be to anyone’s advantage to\r\ndestroy the will? The hospitals benefit, yes; but one cannot suspect\r\ninstitutions!”\r\n\r\n“Perhaps the old man changed his mind and destroyed it himself,” I\r\nsuggested.\r\n\r\nPoirot rose to his feet, dusting his knees with his usual care.\r\n\r\n“That may be,” he admitted. “One of your more sensible observations,\r\nHastings. Well, we can do no more here. We have done all that mortal\r\nman can do. We have successfully pitted our wits against the late\r\nAndrew Marsh, but unfortunately his niece is no better off for our\r\nsuccess.”\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBy driving to the station at once, we were just able to catch a train\r\nto London, though not the principal express. Poirot was sad and\r\ndissatisfied. For my part, I was tired and dozed in a corner.\r\nSuddenly, as we were just moving out of Taunton, Poirot uttered a\r\npiercing squeal.\r\n\r\n“_Vite_, Hastings! Awake and jump. But jump, I say!”\r\n\r\nBefore I knew where I was, we were standing on the platform,\r\nbareheaded and minus our valises, while the train disappeared into the\r\nnight. I was furious, but Poirot paid no attention.\r\n\r\n“Imbecile that I have been!” he cried. “Triple imbecile! Not again\r\nwill I vaunt my little gray cells!”\r\n\r\n“That’s a good job, at any rate,” I said grumpily. “But what is this\r\nall about?”\r\n\r\nAs usual, when following out his own ideas, he paid absolutely no\r\nattention to me.\r\n\r\n“The tradesmen’s books, I have left them entirely out of account! Yes,\r\nbut where? Where? Never mind, I cannot be mistaken. We must return at\r\nonce.”\r\n\r\nEasier said than done. We managed to get a slow train to Exeter, and\r\nthere Poirot hired a car. We arrived back at Crabtree Manor in the\r\nsmall hours of the morning. I pass over the bewilderment of the Bakers\r\nwhen we had at last aroused them. Paying no attention to anybody,\r\nPoirot strode at once to the study.\r\n\r\n“I have been, not a triple imbecile, but thirty-six times one, my\r\nfriend,” he deigned to remark. “Now, behold!”\r\n\r\nGoing straight to the desk, he drew out the key, and detached the\r\nenvelope from it. I stared at him stupidly. How could he possibly hope\r\nto find a big will-form in that tiny envelope? With great care he cut\r\nopen the envelope, laying it out flat. Then he lighted the fire and\r\nheld the plain inside surface of the envelope to the flame. In a few\r\nminutes faint characters began to appear.\r\n\r\n“Look!” cried Poirot in triumph.\r\n\r\nI looked. There were just a few lines of faint writing stating briefly\r\nthat he left everything to his niece Violet Marsh. It was dated March\r\n25, twelve-thirty p. m., and witnessed by Albert Pike, confectioner,\r\nand Jessie Pike, married woman.\r\n\r\n“But is it legal?” I gasped.\r\n\r\n“As far as I know, there is no law against writing your will in a\r\nblend of disappearing and sympathetic ink. The intention of the\r\ntestator is clear, and the beneficiary is his only living relation.\r\nBut the cleverness of him! He foresaw every step that a searcher would\r\ntake, that I, miserable imbecile, took! He gets two will-forms, makes\r\nthe servants sign twice, then sallies out with his will written on the\r\ninside of a dirty envelope, and a fountain pen containing his little\r\nink-mixture. On some excuse he gets the confectioner and his wife to\r\nsign their names under his own signature; then he ties it to the key\r\nof his desk and chuckles to himself. If his niece sees through his\r\nlittle ruse, she will have justified her choice of life and elaborate\r\neducation and be thoroughly welcome to his money.”\r\n\r\n“She didn’t see through it, did she?” I said slowly. “It seems rather\r\nunfair. The old man really won.”\r\n\r\n“But no, Hastings! It is _your_ wits that go astray. Miss Marsh proved\r\nthe astuteness of her wits and the value of the higher education for\r\nwomen by at once putting the matter in _my_ hands. Always employ the\r\nexpert! She has amply proved her right to the money.”\r\n\r\nI wonder—I very much wonder what old Andrew Marsh would have thought!\r\n\r\n\r\n[Transcriber’s Note: This story appeared in the January, 1925 issue of\r\nThe Blue Book Magazine.]"

P. Putnam's Sons\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nBy THE light of a tallow candle, which had been placed on one end of a\r\nrough table, a man was reading something written in a book. It was an\r\nold account book, greatly worn; and the writing was not, apparently,\r\nvery legible, for the man sometimes held the page close to the flame of\r\nthe candle to get a stronger light upon it. The shadow of the book would\r\nthen throw into obscurity a half of the room, darkening a number of\r\nfaces and figures; for besides the reader, eight other men were present.\r\nSeven of them sat against the rough log walls, silent and motionless,\r\nand, the room being small, not very far from the table. By extending an\r\narm any one of them could have touched the eighth man, who lay on the\r\ntable, face upward, partly covered by a sheet, his arms at his sides. He\r\nwas dead.\r\n\r\nThe man with the book was not reading aloud, and no one spoke; all\r\nseemed to be waiting for something to occur; the dead man only was\r\nwithout expectation. From the blank darkness outside came in, through\r\nthe aperture that served for a window, all the ever unfamiliar noises\r\nof night in the wilderness--the long, nameless note of a distant coyote;\r\nthe stilly pulsing thrill of tireless insects in trees; strange cries of\r\nnight birds, so different from those of the birds of day; the drone of\r\ngreat blundering beetles, and all that mysterious chorus of small sounds\r\nthat seem always to have been but half heard when they have suddenly\r\nceased, as if conscious of an indiscretion. But nothing of all this was\r\nnoted in that company; its members were not overmuch addicted to idle\r\ninterest in matters of no practical importance; that was obvious in\r\nevery line of their rugged faces--obvious even in the dim light of the\r\nsingle candle. They were evidently men of the vicinity--farmers and\r\nwoodmen.\r\n\r\nThe person reading was a trifle different; one would have said of him\r\nthat he was of the world, worldly, albeit there was that in his\r\nattire which attested a certain fellowship with the organisms of his\r\nenvironment. His coat would hardly have passed muster in San Francisco:\r\nhis footgear was not of urban origin, and the hat that lay by him on\r\nthe floor (he was the only one uncovered) was such that if one had\r\nconsidered it as an article of mere personal adornment he would have\r\nmissed its meaning. In countenance the man was rather prepossessing,\r\nwith just a hint of sternness; though that he may have assumed or\r\ncultivated, as appropriate to one in authority. For he was a coroner. It\r\nwas by virtue of his office that he had possession of the book in which\r\nhe was reading; it had been found among the dead man's effects--in his\r\ncabin, where the inquest was now taking place.\r\n\r\nWhen the coroner had finished reading he put the book into his breast\r\npocket. At that moment the door was pushed open and a young man entered.\r\nHe, clearly, was not of mountain birth and breeding: he was clad as\r\nthose who dwell in cities. His clothing was dusty, however, as from\r\ntravel. He had, in fact, been riding hard to attend the inquest.\r\n\r\nThe coroner nodded; no one else greeted him.\r\n\r\n\"We have waited for you,\" said the coroner. \"It is necessary to have\r\ndone with this business to-night.\"\r\n\r\nThe young man smiled. \"I am sorry to have kept you,\" he said. \"I went\r\naway, not to evade your summons, but to post to my newspaper an account\r\nof what I suppose I am called back to relate.\"\r\n\r\nThe coroner smiled.\r\n\r\n\"The account that you posted to your newspaper,\" he said, \"differs\r\nprobably from that which you will give here under oath.\"\r\n\r\n\"That,\" replied the other, rather hotly and with a visible flush, \"is as\r\nyou choose. I used manifold paper and have a copy of what I sent. It was\r\nnot written as news, for it is incredible, but as fiction. It may go as\r\na part of my testimony under oath.\"\r\n\r\n\"But you say it is incredible.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is nothing to you, sir, if I also swear that it is true.\"\r\n\r\nThe coroner was apparently not greatly affected by the young man's\r\nmanifest resentment. He was silent for some moments, his eyes upon the\r\nfloor. The men about the sides of the cabin talked in whispers, but\r\nseldom withdrew their gaze from the face of the corpse. Presently the\r\ncoroner lifted his eyes and said: \"We will resume the inquest.\"\r\n\r\nThe men removed their hats. The witness was sworn.\r\n\r\n\"What is your name?\" the coroner asked.\r\n\r\n\"William Harker.\"\r\n\r\n\"Age?\"\r\n\r\n\"Twenty-seven.\"\r\n\r\n\"You knew the deceased, Hugh Morgan?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"You were with him when he died?\"\r\n\r\n\"Near him.\"\r\n\r\n\"How did that happen--your presence, I mean?\"\r\n\r\n\"I was visiting him at this place to shoot and fish. A part of my\r\npurpose, however, was to study him, and his odd, solitary way of life.\r\nHe seemed a good model for a character in fiction. I sometimes write\r\nstories.\"\r\n\r\n\"I sometimes read them.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Stories in general--not yours.\"\r\n\r\nSome of the jurors laughed. Against a sombre background humor shows high\r\nlights. Soldiers in the intervals of battle laugh easily, and a jest in\r\nthe death chamber conquers by surprise.\r\n\r\n\"Relate the circumstances of this man's death,\" said the coroner. \"You\r\nmay use any notes or memoranda that you please.\"\r\n\r\nThe witness understood. Pulling a manuscript from his breast pocket\r\nhe held it near the candle, and turning the leaves until he found the\r\npassage that he wanted, began to read.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\n\"...The sun had hardly risen when we left the house. We were looking for\r\nquail, each with a shotgun, but we had only one dog. Morgan said that\r\nour best ground was beyond a certain ridge that he pointed out, and we\r\ncrossed it by a trail through the _chaparral_. On the other side was\r\ncomparatively level ground, thickly covered with wild oats. As we\r\nemerged from the _chaparral_, Morgan was but a few yards in advance.\r\nSuddenly, we heard, at a little distance to our right, and partly in\r\nfront, a noise as of some animal thrashing about in the bushes, which we\r\ncould see were violently agitated.\r\n\r\n\"'We've started a deer,' said. 'I wish we had brought a rifle.'\r\n\r\n\"Morgan, who had stopped and was intently watching the agitated\r\nchaparral, said nothing, but had cocked both barrels of his gun, and was\r\nholding it in readiness to aim. I thought him a trifle excited, which\r\nsurprised me, for he had a reputation for exceptional coolness, even in\r\nmoments of sudden and imminent peril.\r\n\r\n\"'O, come!' I said. 'You are not going to fill up a deer with\r\nquail-shot, are you?'\r\n\r\n\"Still he did not reply; but, catching a sight of his face as he\r\nturned it slightly toward me, I was struck by the pallor of it. Then I\r\nunderstood that we had serious business on hand, and my first conjecture\r\nwas that we had 'jumped' a grizzly. I advanced to Morgan's side, cocking\r\nmy piece as I moved.\r\n\r\n\"The bushes were now quiet, and the sounds had ceased, but Morgan was as\r\nattentive to the place as before.\r\n\r\n\"'What is it? What the devil is it?' I asked.\r\n\r\n\"'That Damned Thing!' he replied, without turning his head. His voice\r\nwas husky and unnatural. He trembled visibly.\r\n\r\n\"I was about to speak further, when I observed the wild oats near the\r\nplace of the disturbance moving in the most inexplicable way. I can\r\nhardly describe it. It seemed as if stirred by a streak of wind, which\r\nnot only bent it, but pressed it down--crushed it so that it did not\r\nrise, and this movement was slowly prolonging itself directly toward us.\r\n\r\n\"Nothing that I had ever seen had affected me so strangely as this\r\nunfamiliar and unaccountable phenomenon, yet I am unable to recall any\r\nsense of fear. I remember--and tell it here because, singularly enough,\r\nI recollected it then--that once, in looking carelessly out of an open\r\nwindow, I momentarily mistook a small tree close at hand for one of a\r\ngroup of larger trees at a little distance away. It looked the same size\r\nas the others, but, being more distinctly and sharply defined in mass\r\nand detail, seemed out of harmony with them. It was a mere falsification\r\nof the law of aerial perspective, but it startled, almost terrified me.\r\nWe so rely upon the orderly operation of familiar natural laws that any\r\nseeming suspension of them is noted as a menace to our safety, a warning\r\nof unthinkable calamity. So now the apparently causeless movement of the\r\nherbage, and the slow, undeviating approach of the line of disturbance\r\nwere distinctly disquieting. My companion appeared actually frightened,\r\nand I could hardly credit my senses when I saw him suddenly throw his\r\ngun to his shoulders and fire both barrels at the agitated grass! Before\r\nthe smoke of the discharge had cleared away I heard a loud savage\r\ncry--a scream like that of a wild animal--and, flinging his gun upon the\r\nground, Morgan sprang away and ran swiftly from the spot. At the same\r\ninstant I was thrown violently to the ground by the impact of something\r\nunseen in the smoke--some soft, heavy substance that seemed thrown\r\nagainst me with great force.\r\n\r\n\"Before I could get upon my feet and recover my gun, which seemed to\r\nhave been struck from my hands, I heard Morgan crying out as if in\r\nmortal agony, and mingling with his cries were such hoarse savage sounds\r\nas one hears from fighting dogs. Inexpressibly terrified, I struggled to\r\nmy feet and looked in the direction of Morgan's retreat; and may heaven\r\nin mercy spare me from another sight like that! At a distance of less\r\nthan thirty yards was my friend, down upon one knee, his head thrown\r\nback at a frightful angle, hatless, his long hair in disorder and his\r\nwhole body in violent movement from side to side, backward and forward.\r\nHis right arm was lifted and seemed to lack the hand--at least, I\r\ncould see none. The other arm was invisible. At times, as my memory\r\nnow reports this extraordinary scene, I could discern but a part of his\r\nbody; it was as if he had been partly blotted out--I can not otherwise\r\nexpress it--then a shifting of his position would bring it all into view\r\nagain.\r\n\r\n\"All this must have occurred within a few seconds, yet in that time\r\nMorgan assumed all the postures of a determined wrestler vanquished by\r\nsuperior weight and strength. I saw nothing but him, and him not always\r\ndistinctly. During the entire incident his shouts and curses were heard,\r\nas if through an enveloping uproar of such sounds of rage and fury as I\r\nhad never heard from the throat of man or brute!\r\n\r\n\"For a moment only I stood irresolute, then, throwing down my gun, I\r\nran forward to my friend's assistance. I had a vague belief that he was\r\nsuffering from a fit or some form of convulsion. Before I could reach\r\nhis side he was down and quiet. All sounds had ceased, but, with a\r\nfeeling of such terror as even these awful events had not inspired, I\r\nnow saw the same mysterious movement of the wild oats prolonging itself\r\nfrom the trampled area about the prostrate man toward the edge of\r\na wood. It was only when it had reached the wood that I was able to\r\nwithdraw my eyes and look at my companion. He was dead.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nThe coroner rose from his seat and stood beside the dead man. Lifting\r\nan edge of the sheet he pulled it away, exposing the entire body,\r\naltogether naked and showing in the candle light a clay-like yellow. It\r\nhad, however, broad maculations of bluish-black, obviously caused by\r\nextravasated blood from contusions. The chest and sides looked as if\r\nthey had been beaten with a bludgeon. There were dreadful lacerations;\r\nthe skin was torn in strips and shreds.\r\n\r\nThe coroner moved round to the end of the table and undid a silk\r\nhandkerchief, which had been passed under the chin and knotted on the\r\ntop of the head. When the handkerchief was drawn away it exposed what\r\nhad been the throat. Some of the jurors who had risen to get a better\r\nview repented their curiosity, and turned away their faces. Witness\r\nHarker went to the open window and leaned out across the sill, faint and\r\nsick. Dropping the handkerchief upon the dead man's neck, the coroner\r\nstepped to an angle of the room, and from a pile of clothing produced\r\none garment after another, each of which he held up a moment for\r\ninspection. All were torn, and stiff with blood. The jurors did not\r\nmake a closer inspection. They seemed rather uninterested. They had, in\r\ntruth, seen all this before; the only thing that was new to them being\r\nHarker's testimony.\r\n\r\n\"Gentlemen,\" the coroner said, \"we have no more evidence, I think. Your\r\nduty has been already explained to you; if there is nothing you wish to\r\nask you may go outside and consider your verdict.\"\r\n\r\nThe foreman rose--a tall, bearded man of sixty, coarsely clad.\r\n\r\n\"I should like to ask one question, Mr. Coroner,\" he said. \"What asylum\r\ndid this yer last witness escape from?\"\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Harker,\" said the coroner, gravely and tranquilly, \"from what\r\nasylum did you last escape?\"\r\n\r\nHarker flushed crimson again, but said nothing, and the seven jurors\r\nrose and solemnly filed out of the cabin.\r\n\r\n\"If you have done insulting me, sir,\" said Harker, as soon as he and the\r\nofficer were left alone with the dead man, \"I suppose I am at liberty to\r\ngo?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\nHarker started to leave, but paused, with his hand on the door latch.\r\nThe habit of his profession was strong in him--stronger than his sense\r\nof personal dignity. He turned about and said:\r\n\r\n\"The book that you have there--I recognize it as Morgan's diary. You\r\nseemed greatly interested in it; you read in it while I was testifying.\r\nMay I see it? The public would like--\"\r\n\r\n\"The book will cut no figure in this matter,\" replied the official,\r\nslipping it into his coat pocket; \"all the entries in it were made\r\nbefore the writer's death.\"\r\n\r\nAs Harker passed out of the house the jury reentered and stood about the\r\ntable on which the now covered corpse showed under the sheet with sharp\r\ndefinition. The foreman seated himself near the candle, produced\r\nfrom his breast pocket a pencil and scrap of paper, and wrote rather\r\nlaboriously the following verdict, which with various degrees of effort\r\nall signed:\r\n\r\n\"We, the jury, do find that the remains come to their death at the hands\r\nof a mountain lion, but some of us thinks, all the same, they had fits.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nIn the diary of the late Hugh Morgan are certain interesting entries\r\nhaving, possibly, a scientific value as suggestions. At the inquest upon\r\nhis body the book was not put in evidence; possibly the coroner thought\r\nit not worth while to confuse the jury. The date of the first of the\r\nentries mentioned can not be ascertained; the upper part of the leaf is\r\ntorn away; the part of the entry remaining is as follows:\r\n\r\n\"... would run in a half circle, keeping his head turned always toward\r\nthe centre and again he would stand still, barking furiously. At last he\r\nran away into the brush as fast as he could go. I thought at first that\r\nhe had gone mad, but on returning to the house found no other alteration\r\nin his manner than what was obviously due to fear of punishment.\r\n\r\n\"Can a dog see with his nose? Do odors impress some olfactory centre\r\nwith images of the thing emitting them? . . .\r\n\r\n\"Sept 2.--Looking at the stars last night as they rose above the\r\ncrest of the ridge east of the house, I observed them successively\r\ndisappear--from left to right. Each was eclipsed but an instant, and\r\nonly a few at the same time, but along the entire length of the ridge\r\nall that were within a degree or two of the crest were blotted out. It\r\nwas as if something had passed along between me and them; but I could\r\nnot see it, and the stars were not thick enough to define its outline.\r\nUgh! I don't like this. . . .\"\r\n\r\nSeveral weeks' entries are missing, three leaves being torn from the\r\nbook.\r\n\r\n\"Sept. 27.--It has been about here again--I find evidences of its\r\npresence every day. I watched again all of last night in the same cover,\r\ngun in hand, double-charged with buckshot. In the morning the fresh\r\nfootprints were there, as before. Yet I would have sworn that I did not\r\nsleep--indeed, I hardly sleep at all. It is terrible, insupportable! If\r\nthese amazing experiences are real I shall go mad; if they are fanciful\r\nI am mad already.\r\n\r\n\"Oct. 3.--I shall not go--it shall not drive me away. No, this is _my_\r\nhouse, my land. God hates a coward....\r\n\r\n\"Oct. 5.--I can stand it no longer; I have invited Harker to pass a few\r\nweeks with me--he has a level head. I can judge from his manner if he\r\nthinks me mad.\r\n\r\n\"Oct. 7.--I have the solution of the problem; it came to me last\r\nnight--suddenly, as by revelation. How simple--how terribly simple!\r\n\r\n\"There are sounds that we can not hear. At either end of the scale are\r\nnotes that stir no chord of that imperfect instrument, the human ear.\r\nThey are too high or too grave. I have observed a flock of blackbirds\r\noccupying an entire treetop--the tops of several trees--and all in full\r\nsong. Suddenly--in a moment--at absolutely the same instant--all\r\nspring into the air and fly away. How? They could not all see one\r\nanother--whole treetops intervened. At no point could a leader have been\r\nvisible to all. There must have been a signal of warning or command,\r\nhigh and shrill above the din, but by me unheard. I have observed,\r\ntoo, the same simultaneous flight when all were silent, among not only\r\nblackbirds, but other birds--quail, for example, widely separated by\r\nbushes--even on opposite sides of a hill.\r\n\r\n\"It is known to seamen that a school of whales basking or sporting on\r\nthe surface of the ocean, miles apart, with the convexity of the earth\r\nbetween them, will sometimes dive at the same instant--all gone out of\r\nsight in a moment. The signal has been sounded--too grave for the ear\r\nof the sailor at the masthead and his comrades on the deck--who\r\nnevertheless feel its vibrations in the ship as the stones of a\r\ncathedral are stirred by the bass of the organ.\r\n\r\n\"As with sounds, so with colors. At each end of the solar spectrum the\r\nchemist can detect the presence of what are known as 'actinic'\r\nrays. They represent colors--integral colors in the composition of\r\nlight--which we are unable to discern. The human eye is an imperfect\r\ninstrument; its range is but a few octaves of the real 'chromatic scale'\r\nI am not mad; there are colors that we can not see.\r\n\r\n\"And, God help me! the Damned Thing is of such a color!\""

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\r\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\r\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\r\nparticular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States.

Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\r\nTo donate, please visit:\r\nhttp://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\r\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\r\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\r\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\r\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\r\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\r\n\r\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks."

    "content": "IN MID-AIR\r\n\r\n                        By R. J. McSwiney\r\n\r\n            A War-time Flyer, Unable to Land Without\r\n            Killing Himself, Decides to Die Gloriously\r\n\r\n\r\nSix thousand feet the aneroid registered, and the objective was already\r\nbeginning to take definite form in the blurred landscape below.\r\n\r\nA cluster of drab, canvas buildings, whose weirdly painted forms were\r\nhard to discern against the sea of mud constituting their background,\r\nwas all that could, as yet, be seen of the airdrome that had been picked\r\nout for that morning’s bombing raid into the enemy’s lines.\r\n\r\nIt was a chill winter morning, with swiftly moving, low-lying clouds\r\nscurrying ceaselessly across the gray sky--ideal for such an expedition.\r\n\r\nThe squadron, flying high, changed course whenever the fleeting clouds\r\ninterposed themselves between it and the crews manning the anti-aircraft\r\nguns below. These, having to estimate where each change of course would\r\ncarry their targets, were firing largely at random and their shooting\r\nwas correspondingly poor. The smoke from their bursting shells,\r\nappearing sullenly among the clouds like sinister wads of black cotton\r\nwool, dotted the sky everywhere but in the direct path of the raiding\r\nmachines.\r\n\r\nIn the rearmost plane, forming the left tip of the wedge formation,\r\nCharley Reid was straining his eyes to obtain a correct mental\r\nimpression of his target and to ascertain the relation of his altitude\r\nand speed to the objective on the ground. This would enable him to\r\ndetermine the crucial moment at which to operate the release gear and\r\nsend hurtling earthward the three hundred pounds of concentrated\r\ndestructive force, which he carried slung from the undercarriage of his\r\nmachine.\r\n\r\nHe was flying an old type of tractor biplane, which, having gone out of\r\ndate for fighting purposes, had been assigned to raiding duties. Not\r\nbeing equipped for regular bombing, these converted planes carried but a\r\nsingle heavy torpedo, slung from the undercarriage in such a way that it\r\ncould be released at will by the pilot from his seat, by means of a\r\nsimple lever. The nose of the bomb is released first and, as the heavy\r\nfore end falls away from the plane, the wind catches it and drives it\r\noff the rear hook, whence it falls earthward, guided by the vanes and\r\ngradually assuming a more vertical descent as the resistance of the air\r\novercomes its forward motion.\r\n\r\nWith his eyes now glued on the indistinct blur that represented his\r\ntarget, Reid made a rapid mental calculation to determine the horizontal\r\ndistance from his objective at which to release his missile so that it\r\nshould strike the ground at the desired point. A glance at the map\r\npinned down in front of him showed that, when vertically above a certain\r\nroad crossing, he would be at the required distance.\r\n\r\nThe crossing showed up plainly to his view as he rode past a rift in the\r\nclouds. He modified his course slightly to bring himself, the landmark,\r\nand the objective into correct alignment, and focused his gaze on the\r\ntarget, whose location was, now, clearly discernible, even through the\r\nscudding mist.\r\n\r\nThere! The leading plane of the squadron had dropped its messenger of\r\ndeath and defiance, and the large white feather of smoke that drifted\r\nquickly away from the spot proved that the pilot, not bothered by\r\n“Accurate Archie,” the anti-aircraft gun, had been able to take careful\r\nobservations and had registered a direct hit. They were evidently going\r\nto make a good job of it!\r\n\r\nThere, again! And again! In quick succession, now, the white feathers\r\nsprang up among the crowded hangars, and Reid could even hear the dull\r\nreports of the explosions. Figures, too, could be observed running\r\nwildly to the shelter of the trenches dug by the farsighted Boche in\r\nanticipation of such an eventuality.\r\n\r\nIt would soon be Reid’s turn. His hand went out to the release mechanism\r\nand he glanced downward, over the leading edge of his lower plane. No,\r\nnot quite yet! A second more and--there! He was directly above his\r\nlandmark and headed straight for the group of hangars. He pulled the\r\nlever smartly and, immediately, set himself firmly to meet the sudden\r\njump of the plane on losing three hundred pounds of ballast.\r\n\r\nTensely, he clung to the wheel; but, to his gradually dawning surprise,\r\nno jump resulted. Instead, the plane began to behave in a most\r\ndisconcerting manner. It tilted and side-slipped violently, first one\r\nway and then another, throbbing incessantly as though from the vibration\r\nof an immense spring and shaking so severely that he feared it might\r\ncome to pieces at any moment.\r\n\r\nHad he bungled? Was he hit? were his first thoughts. But no! Past\r\naccidents had taught him how the plane would have acted if such had been\r\nthe case. This was something different and unprecedented in his whole\r\nexperience. Quickly recovering from his surprise, he steadied the\r\njolting machine and started to climb back behind the clouds as rapidly\r\nas he could. As he rose through the enveloping mist, the peculiar antics\r\nof his machine furnished him with the explanation of their origin.\r\nEvidently, the release gear had worked smoothly, freeing the nose of the\r\nbomb, but its other end, for some reason, must have failed to become\r\nunhooked from the rear pin. He was now carrying the torpedo suspended\r\nvertically beneath him from one end, swinging crazily in the wind, and\r\nits erratic oscillations were threatening to overturn the plane, which\r\nresponded to every heave with uncomfortable joltings. He smiled grimly\r\nin spite of himself; this was indeed a case of the tail wagging the dog!\r\n\r\nThen the full significance of his position dawned on him. On the action\r\nof the release gear, the bomb had automatically become detonated, so\r\nthat, now, the lightest graze on its sensitive nose cap would\r\nundoubtedly cause it to explode; he shuddered to think with what result\r\nto himself and his plane.\r\n\r\nRealizing the extent of his danger and the necessity of freeing himself\r\nof the encumbrance, he tried to shake it off the hook, where it had\r\ncaught. Nose-diving steeply, until the jerk of his machine told him that\r\nthe bomb had reached the rearmost limit of its swing, he zoomed\r\nviolently, trying to lift his plane at as steep an angle as practicable.\r\nBut, unfortunately, the old E. 8 was not built for rapid climbing, and\r\nall his efforts resulted only in increasing the stress on his plane to\r\nsuch an extent that he gave up these maneuvers in fear of buckling his\r\nwings.\r\n\r\nHe steadied his plane again, and looked round him. The remainder of the\r\nsquadron was nowhere to be seen; it was back at the airdrome by this\r\ntime, he supposed. He looked downward to get his bearings and started\r\noff after them. They might be able to suggest something to rid him of\r\nhis unpleasant appendage. Under the friendly cover of the clouds, he\r\nopened up his engine and was soon circling round his own flying field,\r\nat as low an altitude as he dared, in the hope that his comrades would\r\nsee his plight and come to his assistance, though, as a matter of fact,\r\nhe did not see how they could do anything to help him.\r\n\r\nHe dared not land. The shock of the bomb on the ground would certainly\r\nbe sufficient to explode it, however easily he might attempt the feat.\r\nHe could not stay up in the air forever, that was equally certain; and,\r\nbesides, he had only enough gas to carry him for a few hours longer. Was\r\nhe doomed? He realized that he was unless something was done, and done\r\nimmediately.\r\n\r\nHis maneuvers had the result, first, of bringing everybody out from the\r\nhangars to watch him, and, then, of sending them hurrying off to\r\nshelter, in fear that the bomb was in danger of falling off and dropping\r\namong them.\r\n\r\nFor a few moments, he was at a loss for some means of communicating with\r\nthe ground, and he cursed the parsimonious policy that had refused to\r\nequip these converted machines with wireless.\r\n\r\nWith difficulty, he extracted a notebook from his pocket and, steadying\r\nthe plane to reduce the incessant jolting as much as possible, he set\r\nabout the awkward task of writing a message. The control required the\r\nuse of both hands and the rush of wind made the paper difficult to keep\r\nin place, but he accomplished the work eventually, writing a few\r\nletters, hastily, at a time. “Bomb stuck on rear hook,” he penciled\r\nlaboriously. “Can you suggest anything?” Then, descending as low as he\r\ndared over the center of the landing field, he cast his missives over\r\nthe side.\r\n\r\nRising again in wide spirals to a safer altitude, he watched the flimsy\r\npaper float slowly down and was relieved to see that it had been\r\nobserved, for a figure darted out of the headquarters tent and stationed\r\nitself in the center of the field to receive it. Would it never reach\r\nthe ground? He could see it flutter earthward, blown hither and thither\r\nby the wind, the figure of the mechanic below changing position\r\nconstantly, so as to be beneath when it landed. At length, it reached\r\nthe ground, was picked up, and carried into the headquarters tent.\r\n\r\nA long wait ensued, fraught with anxiety for the impatient Reid, during\r\nwhich a conference was, no doubt, being held. After some time, a ground\r\nflapper was brought out and commenced flashing a message to him. “Cannot\r\nsuggest anything unless you can shake it off, but do not try it here,”\r\nhe spelled out. So! It was as he thought. They could not help him.\r\n\r\nCould he not, by flying low over some treetops, brush the devilish thing\r\noff? No, he knew that the concussion would be sufficient to explode the\r\nbomb. God! If he only had an observer with him, or if he could only\r\nleave the control for a few seconds!\r\n\r\nHis utter helplessness left him dazed and numbed. An overwhelming\r\nemotion of self-pity surged up in his breast and a bitter, unreasoning\r\nfeeling of resentment against his fate held him in its grip. He groaned\r\naloud in his despair and, for a few moments, was completely oblivious to\r\nhis surroundings.\r\n\r\nHis brain cleared, however, and, gritting his teeth desperately, he\r\nstruggled to regain the mastery over himself--to think clearly. There\r\nwas no use giving in. No, he must die! Then let him choose a man’s death\r\nand die in a fashion that would turn his fatal accident to some good\r\naccount in his country’s service.\r\n\r\nA hazy plan was forming itself in his brain. Still circling over the\r\nhome airdrome, he looked at his map, on which all targets were clearly\r\nrecorded, and picked out a German headquarters that was marked for early\r\ndestruction. Yes, that was it. He would land on this, and the explosion\r\nthat sent him into eternity should send with him a number of the hated\r\nenemy. There would be no question, this time, of his bungling or\r\nmissing. He would save his squadron a trip.\r\n\r\nHis mind once made up, he was not slow to act. He raised his elevators\r\nand soared up to a sufficiently high altitude to bring him above the\r\nshelter of the clouds and steered directly for his new objective. A few\r\nminutes were sufficient to bring him to its vicinity unobserved and,\r\ndropping slowly, he began searching the country for his new target. By\r\nfrequent comparison of the ground with his map, it was not long before\r\nhe recognized the commandeered chateau, where the German general and his\r\nstaff had established themselves. He saw the broad ribbon of the _route\r\nnationale_, bordered with high trees and telegraph poles, and the\r\nbuilding he was intent on destroying some twenty yards on the far side\r\nof it. He pointed his plane at the road in front of the house, where he\r\nplanned to flatten out his dive, so as to crash into the center of its\r\nfacade at a height that would allow the torpedo to strike over the\r\nentrance.\r\n\r\nHe began his steep dive, and as he felt the chill air rush and roar past\r\nhis ears, his emotions underwent a great change. Now he experienced a\r\nwonderful exhilaration. Yes, he would die, but willingly and usefully!\r\nAnd, by God, he would wipe out of existence this Huns’ nest of mischief\r\nin his passing! He could have shouted with the exaltation he felt at the\r\nmoment--he was inspired in the performance of a great deed.\r\n\r\nBelow, he saw the fields widen out smoothly to his view, as his dizzy\r\ndescent shortened his perspective, like a picture slide being focused on\r\na giant screen; he saw the broadening white band of the road and the\r\ngables of the chateau beyond, rocking and swaying, come leaping and\r\nbounding up to meet him. He saw figures rushing madly about and was\r\nconscious of machine guns rattling somewhere on the ground, but his\r\ndescent from behind the clouds had been so sudden and so swift that he\r\nwas but a poor target for the gunners.\r\n\r\nIn a few moments he would be on the place.\r\n\r\nAs he flashed over the road between two giant elms, he flattened his\r\ndive and started his engine. A defiant yell was torn from his lips and\r\nhe closed his eyes, waiting to be dashed to his glorious, if terrible,\r\ndeath against the graystone front of the building.\r\n\r\nHis eyes were barely closed when a violent jerk on its tail raised the\r\nnose of his plane in the air. Mechanically, like a pilot taught to act\r\ninstinctively on the least untoward movement of his plane, he righted\r\nthe machine, but the sudden rise had sent him clear, in that short\r\ndistance even, of the slate roof of his objective.\r\n\r\nThis happened so quickly that the jerk of his machine caused him to open\r\nhis eyes with the thought that he had missed again. The last of the\r\npeaked roofs was still streaming back beneath him, when a deafening\r\nexplosion rent the air, and he was enveloped in smoke and dust.\r\n\r\nHis plane rocked violently, but he steadied it and instinctively turned\r\ntoward his own lines, commencing to climb as rapidly as he could without\r\ninterfering with the speed of his machine. Escape was his one thought,\r\nnow; the rattle of machine guns and the bursting of anti-aircraft shells\r\noccupied the whole of his attention. He zigzagged, climbed, dived and\r\nclimbed again; he resorted to every maneuver he had ever been taught and\r\nthat his old craft was capable of performing, until, at length, his\r\nexhaust roaring and his engine at its highest speed, he crossed his own\r\nlines safely.\r\n\r\nOnce across No Man’s Land, he toned his engine down and proceeded more\r\nleisurely toward his airdrome, allowing his thoughts to return to his\r\nmiraculous escape.\r\n\r\nEvidently, as he had swept across the road and flattened his dive, he\r\nhad unintentionally swung the bomb against the telephone cables between\r\ntwo adjacent poles, and they had possessed sufficient resiliency and\r\nresistance to sweep it off the hook where it had become stuck. Its own\r\nmomentum had carried the bulky torpedo the rest of the way and, as he\r\npassed over the far end of the chateau, the bomb was dashed against its\r\nfront at the very place where he had intended it to strike. The jerk\r\ncaused by the bomb striking the wires had tilted the machine\r\nsufficiently to cause it to clear the roof.\r\n\r\nThere was a happy smile on the face of the limp body that the mechanics\r\nlifted out of the nacelle of the old converted bombing plane when it\r\nmade its clumsy landing at the airdrome shortly afterward.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Transcriber’s Note: This story appeared in the Second January number,\r\n1930, of _The Popular Magazine_.]"

At the\r\nfurther end of the wood was another pretty cottage and in it lived her\r\ngrandmother.\r\n\r\nEverybody loved this little girl, her grandmother perhaps loved her\r\nmost of all and gave her a great many pretty things. Once she gave her\r\na red cloak with a hood which she always wore, so people called her\r\nLittle Red Riding Hood.\r\n\r\nOne morning Little Red Riding Hood's mother said, \"Put on your things\r\nand go to see your grandmother. She has been ill; take along this\r\nbasket for her. I have put in it eggs, butter and cake, and other\r\ndainties.\"\r\n\r\nIt was a bright and sunny morning. Red Riding Hood was so happy that\r\nat first she wanted to dance through the wood. All around her grew\r\npretty wild flowers which she loved so well and she stopped to pick a\r\nbunch for her grandmother.\r\n\r\nLittle Red Riding Hood wandered from her path and was stooping to pick\r\na flower when from behind her a gruff voice said, \"Good morning,\r\nLittle Red Riding Hood.\" Little Red Riding Hood turned around and saw\r\na great big wolf, but Little Red Riding Hood did not know what a\r\nwicked beast the wolf was, so she was not afraid.\r\n\r\n\"What have you in that basket, Little Red Riding Hood?\"\r\n\r\n\"Eggs and butter and cake, Mr. Wolf.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where are you going with them, Little Red Riding Hood?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am going to my grandmother, who is ill, Mr. Wolf.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where does your grandmother live, Little Red Riding Hood?\"\r\n\r\n\"Along that path, past the wild rose bushes, then through the gate at\r\nthe end of the wood, Mr. Wolf.\"\r\n\r\nThen Mr. Wolf again said \"Good morning\" and set off, and Little Red\r\nRiding Hood again went in search of wild flowers.\r\n\r\nAt last he reached the porch covered with flowers and knocked at the\r\ndoor of the cottage.\r\n\r\n\"Who is there?\" called the grandmother.\r\n\r\n\"Little Red Riding Hood,\" said the wicked wolf.\r\n\r\n\"Press the latch, open the door, and walk in,\" said the grandmother.\r\n\r\nThe wolf pressed the latch, and walked in where the grandmother lay in\r\nbed. He made one jump at her, but she jumped out of bed into a closet.\r\nThen the wolf put on the cap which she had dropped and crept under the\r\nbedclothes.\r\n\r\nIn a short while Little Red Riding Hood knocked at the door, and\r\nwalked in, saying, \"Good morning, Grandmother, I have brought you\r\neggs, butter and cake, and here is a bunch of flowers I gathered in\r\nthe wood.\" As she came nearer the bed she said, \"What big ears you\r\nhave, Grandmother.\"\r\n\r\n\"All the better to hear you with, my dear.\"\r\n\r\n\"What big eyes you have, Grandmother.\"\r\n\r\n\"All the better to see you with, my dear.\"\r\n\r\n\"But, Grandmother, what a big nose you have.\"\r\n\r\n\"All the better to smell with, my dear.\"\r\n\r\n\"But, Grandmother, what a big mouth you have.\"\r\n\r\n\"All the better to eat you up with, my dear,\" he said as he sprang at\r\nLittle Red Riding Hood.\r\n\r\nJust at that moment Little Red Riding Hood's father was passing the\r\ncottage and heard her scream. He rushed in and with his axe chopped\r\noff Mr. Wolf's head.\r\n\r\nEverybody was happy that Little Red Riding Hood had escaped the wolf.\r\nThen Little Red Riding Hood's father carried her home and they lived\r\nhappily ever after.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GOOSE-GIRL\r\n\r\n\r\nThere was once an old Queen who had a very beautiful daughter. The\r\ntime came when the maiden was to go into a distant country to be\r\nmarried. The old Queen packed up everything suitable to a royal\r\noutfit.\r\n\r\nShe also sent a Waiting-woman with her. When the hour of departure\r\ncame they bade each other a sorrowful farewell and set out for the\r\nbridegroom's country.\r\n\r\nWhen they had ridden for a time the Princess became very thirsty, and\r\nsaid to the Waiting-woman, \"Go down and fetch me some water in my cup\r\nfrom the stream. I must have something to drink.\"\r\n\r\n\"If you are thirsty,\" said the Waiting-woman, \"dismount yourself, lie\r\ndown by the water and drink. I don't choose to be your servant.\"\r\n\r\nBeing very thirsty, the Princess dismounted, and knelt by the flowing\r\nwater.\r\n\r\nNow, when she was about to mount her horse again, the Waiting-woman\r\nsaid, \"By rights your horse belongs to me; this jade will do for you!\"\r\n\r\nThe poor little Princess was obliged to give way. Then the\r\nWaiting-woman, in a harsh voice, ordered her to take off her royal\r\nrobes, and to put on her own mean garments. Finally she forced her to\r\nswear that she would not tell a person at the Court what had taken\r\nplace. Had she not taken the oath she would have been killed on the\r\nspot.\r\n\r\nThere was great rejoicing when they arrived at the castle. The Prince\r\nhurried towards them, and lifted the Waiting-woman from her horse,\r\nthinking she was his bride. She was led upstairs, but the real\r\nPrincess had to stay below.\r\n\r\nThe old King looked out of the window and saw the delicate, pretty\r\nlittle creature standing in the courtyard; so he asked the bride about\r\nher companion.\r\n\r\n\"I picked her up on the way, and brought her with me for company. Give\r\nthe girl something to do to keep her from idling.\"\r\n\r\nThe old King said, \"I have a little lad who looks after the geese; she\r\nmay help him.\"\r\n\r\nThe boy was called little Conrad, and the real bride was sent with him\r\nto look after the geese. When they reached the meadow, the Princess\r\nsat down on the grass and let down her hair, and when Conrad saw it he\r\nwas so delighted that he wanted to pluck some out; but she said--\r\n\r\n  \"Blow, blow, little breeze,\r\n  And Conrad's hat seize.\r\n  Let him join in the chase\r\n  While away it is whirled,\r\n  Till my tresses are curled\r\n  And I rest in my place.\"\r\n\r\nThen a strong wind sprang up, which blew away Conrad's hat right over\r\nthe fields, and he had to run after it. When he came back her hair was\r\nall put up again.\r\n\r\nWhen they got home Conrad went to the King and said, \"I won't tend the\r\ngeese with that maiden again.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why not?\" asked the King.\r\n\r\nThen Conrad went on to tell the King all that had happened in the\r\nfield. The King ordered Conrad to go next day as usual and he followed\r\ninto the field and hid behind a bush. He saw it happen just as Conrad\r\nhad told him. Thereupon he went away unnoticed; and in the evening,\r\nwhen the Goose-girl came home, he asked her why she did all these\r\nthings.\r\n\r\n\"That I may not tell you,\" she answered.\r\n\r\nThen he said, \"If you won't tell me, then tell the iron stove there;\"\r\nand he went away.\r\n\r\nShe crept up to the stove and unburdened her heart to it. The King\r\nstood outside by the pipes of the stove and heard all she said. Then\r\nhe came back, and caused royal robes to be put upon her, and her\r\nbeauty was a marvel. Then he called his son and told him that he had a\r\nfalse bride, but that the true bride was here.\r\n\r\nThe Prince was charmed with her beauty and a great banquet was\r\nprepared. The bridegroom sat at the head of the table, with the\r\nPrincess on one side and the Waiting-woman at the other; but she did\r\nnot recognize the Princess.\r\n\r\nWhen they had eaten, the King put a riddle to the Waiting-woman. \"What\r\ndoes a person deserve that deceives his master?\" telling the whole\r\nstory.\r\n\r\nThe false bride answered, \"He must be put into a barrel and dragged\r\nalong by two white horses till he is dead.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is your doom,\" said the King, \"and the judgment shall be carried\r\nout.\"\r\n\r\nWhen the sentence was fulfilled, the young Prince married his true\r\nbride, and they lived together in peace and happiness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBABES IN THE WOOD\r\n\r\n\r\nOnce upon a time there lived two little children whose parents were\r\nill unto death. They begged their brother to care for the two little\r\nones as he would his own.\r\n\r\nThe uncle promised he would be a father to them, but he soon began to\r\nscheme to possess the money the parents had left in his care for the\r\nchildren. He sent for two robbers and bargained with them to take the\r\ntwo babes into the woods and kill them.\r\n\r\nAfter going many miles into the woods one of the robbers said, \"Let us\r\nnot kill the little children, they never harmed us.\" The other robber\r\nwould not consent, so they came to blows. This frightened the children\r\nso much that they ran away and did not see the robbers again.\r\n\r\nThey wandered on and on until they became so tired and hungry that at\r\nlength they sat down at the foot of a tree and cried as if their\r\nhearts would break. The little birds heard them and began to trill\r\nsweet lullabies, which presently lulled them to rest.\r\n\r\nThe birdies knew that the children would die of cold and hunger, so\r\nthey covered them with leaves of crimson and brown and green. They\r\nthen told the angels in Heaven the sad story of the lost babes, and\r\none of the white-robed angels flew down to earth and carried both the\r\nlittle ones back to Heaven, so that when they awoke they were no\r\nlonger tired and hungry, but were again with their dear mother.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SLEEPING BEAUTY\r\n\r\n\r\nOnce upon a time there was a king and queen who for a very long time\r\nhad no children, and when at length a little daughter was born to them\r\nthey were so pleased that they gave a christening feast to which they\r\ninvited a number of fairies. But, unfortunately, they left out one\r\nrather cross old fairy, and she was so angry that she said the\r\nprincess should die when she reached the age of sixteen, by pricking\r\nher hand with a spindle.\r\n\r\nAll the other fairies present, except one, had already given the\r\nprincess their beautiful gifts, and this last one said she could not\r\nprevent part of the wicked wish coming true; but her gift should be\r\nthat the princess should not really die, but only fall into a deep\r\nsleep, which should last for a hundred years, and at the end of that\r\ntime she should be awakened by a king's son.\r\n\r\nIt all happened as the fairies had predicted. When the princess was\r\nsixteen years old she saw an old woman spinning and took the spindle\r\nfrom her to try this strange new work. Instantly she pricked her hand\r\nand fell into a deep sleep, as did everyone else in the palace. There\r\nshe lay in a bower of roses, year after year, and the hedge around the\r\npalace garden grew so tall and thick that at last you could not have\r\ntold that there was a castle at all.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the hundred years a king's son heard of the castle and\r\nthe enchanted princess who lay asleep there and determined to rescue\r\nher. So he cut his way through the thick prickly hedge and at length\r\nhe came to the princess. When he saw how lovely and how sweet she\r\nlooked he fell in love with her and, stooping, kissed her lips.\r\n\r\nAt once she awoke and with her the king and queen and all the\r\ncourtiers, who had fallen asleep at the same time.\r\n\r\nAs the princess was as much taken with the prince's appearance as he\r\nwas with hers, they decided to be married. And so the wedding was\r\ncelebrated the same day with great pomp and ceremony.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSNOWDROP AND SEVEN LITTLE DWARFS\r\n\r\n\r\nOnce upon a time there was a little princess called Snowdrop, who had\r\na cruel step-mother who was jealous of her. The Queen had a magic\r\nmirror, which could speak to her, and when she looked into it and\r\nasked who was the fairest lady in the land the mirror told her she\r\nwas, for she was very beautiful; but as Snowdrop grew up she became\r\nstill more lovely than her step-mother and the mirror did not fail to\r\ntell the Queen this.\r\n\r\nSo she ordered one of her huntsmen to take Snowdrop away and kill her;\r\nbut he was too tender-hearted to do this and left the maiden in the\r\nwood and went home again. Snowdrop wandered about until she came to\r\nthe house of seven little dwarfs, and they were so kind as to take her\r\nin and let her live with them. She used to make their seven little\r\nbeds, and prepare the meals for the seven little men, and they were\r\nall quite happy until the Queen found out from her mirror that\r\nSnowdrop was alive still, for, as it always told the truth, it still\r\ntold her Snowdrop was the fairest lady in the land.\r\n\r\nShe decided that Snowdrop must die, so she dyed her face and dressed\r\nup like an old pedlar, and in this disguise she went to the home of\r\nthe seven Dwarfs and called out, \"Laces for sale.\"\r\n\r\nSnowdrop peeped out of the window and said, \"Good-day, mother; what\r\nhave you to sell?\"\r\n\r\n\"Good laces, fine laces, laces of every color,\" and she held out one\r\nthat was made of gay silk.\r\n\r\nSnowdrop opened the door and bought the pretty lace.\r\n\r\n\"Child,\" said the old woman, \"you are a sight, let me lace you\r\nproperly for once.\"\r\n\r\nSnowdrop placed herself before the old woman, who laced her so quickly\r\nand so tightly that she took away Snowdrop's breath and she fell down\r\nas though dead.\r\n\r\nNot long after the seven dwarfs came home they found that she was\r\nlaced too tight and cut the lace, whereupon Snowdrop began to breathe\r\nand soon came back to life again.\r\n\r\nWhen the Queen got home and found by asking her mirror that Snowdrop\r\nwas still alive, she planned to make an end of her for good, so she\r\nmade a poisoned comb and disguised herself to look like a different\r\nold woman.\r\n\r\nShe journeyed to the dwarfs' home and induced Snowdrop to let her comb\r\nher hair. The minute she put the poisoned comb in her hair Snowdrop\r\nfell down as though dead.\r\n\r\nWhen the seven dwarfs came home they found their poor Snowdrop on the\r\nfloor, and suspecting the bad Queen began to look for the cause, soon\r\nfinding the comb. No sooner had they removed it than Snowdrop came to\r\nlife again.\r\n\r\nUpon the Queen's return home she found by asking her mirror that\r\nSnowdrop still lived, so she disguised herself a third time and came\r\nto the dwarfs' little house and gave Snowdrop a poisoned apple. As\r\nsoon as the little princess took a bite it stuck in her throat and\r\nchoked her.\r\n\r\nOh! how grieved were the good little dwarfs. They made a fine glass\r\ncoffin, and put Snowdrop into it and were carrying her away to bury\r\nher when they met a prince, who fell in love with the little dead\r\nmaiden, and begged the dwarfs to give her to him.\r\n\r\nThe dwarfs were so sorry for him they consented, and the prince's\r\nservants were about to carry the coffin away when they stumbled and\r\nfell over the root of a tree. Snowdrop received such a violent jerk\r\nthat the poisonous apple was jerked right out of her throat and she\r\nsat up alive and well again.\r\n\r\n_Of course_ she married the prince, and she, her husband and the good\r\nlittle dwarfs lived happily ever after, but the cruel step-mother came\r\nto a bad end, and no one was even sorry for her."

It was eleven\r\no'clock and the unused hour was fresh as if issued to children on a\r\nbeach. But there was something solemn in the deliberate swing of the\r\nrepeated strokes; something stirring in the murmur of wheels and the\r\nshuffle of footsteps.\r\n\r\nNo doubt they were not all bound on errands of happiness. There is much\r\nmore to be said about us than that we walk the streets of Westminster.\r\nBig Ben too is nothing but steel rods consumed by rust were it not for\r\nthe care of H. M.'s Office of Works. Only for Mrs Dalloway the moment\r\nwas complete; for Mrs Dalloway June was fresh. A happy childhood--and it\r\nwas not to his daughters only that Justin Parry had seemed a fine fellow\r\n(weak of course on the Bench); flowers at evening, smoke rising; the caw\r\nof rooks falling from ever so high, down down through the October\r\nair--there is nothing to take the place of childhood. A leaf of mint\r\nbrings it back; or a cup with a blue ring.\r\n\r\nPoor little wretches, she sighed, and pressed forward. Oh, right under\r\nthe horses' noses, you little demon! and there she was left on the kerb\r\nstretching her hand out, while Jimmy Dawes grinned on the further side.\r\n\r\nA charming woman, poised, eager, strangely white-haired for her pink\r\ncheeks, so Scope Purvis, C. B., saw her as he hurried to his office. She\r\nstiffened a little, waiting for Durtnall's van to pass. Big Ben struck\r\nthe tenth; struck the eleventh stroke. The leaden circles dissolved in\r\nthe air. Pride held her erect, inheriting, handing on, acquainted with\r\ndiscipline and with suffering. How people suffered, how they suffered,\r\nshe thought, thinking of Mrs Foxcroft at the Embassy last night decked\r\nwith jewels, eating her heart out, because that nice boy was dead, and\r\nnow the old Manor House (Durtnall's van passed) must go to a cousin.\r\n\r\n\"Good morning to you!\" said Hugh Whitbread raising his hat rather\r\nextravagantly by the china shop, for they had known each other as\r\nchildren. \"Where are you off to?\"\r\n\r\n\"I love walking in London\" said Mrs Dalloway. \"Really it's better\r\nthan walking in the country!\"\r\n\r\n\"We've just come up\" said Hugh Whitbread. \"Unfortunately to see\r\ndoctors.\"\r\n\r\n\"Milly?\" said Mrs Dalloway, instantly compassionate.\r\n\r\n\"Out of sorts,\" said Hugh Whitbread. \"That sort of thing. Dick\r\nall right?\"\r\n\r\n\"First rate!\" said Clarissa.\r\n\r\nOf course, she thought, walking on, Milly is about my\r\nage--fifty--fifty-two. So it is probably _that_, Hugh's manner had said\r\nso, said it perfectly--dear old Hugh, thought Mrs Dalloway, remembering\r\nwith amusement, with gratitude, with emotion, how shy, like a\r\nbrother--one would rather die than speak to one's brother--Hugh had\r\nalways been, when he was at Oxford, and came over, and perhaps one of\r\nthem (drat the thing!) couldn't ride. How then could women sit in\r\nParliament? How could they do things with men? For there is this\r\nextraordinarily deep instinct, something inside one; you can't get over\r\nit; it's no use trying; and men like Hugh respect it without our saying\r\nit, which is what one loves, thought Clarissa, in dear old Hugh.\r\n\r\nShe had passed through the Admiralty Arch and saw at the end of the\r\nempty road with its thin trees Victoria's white mound, Victoria's\r\nbillowing motherliness, amplitude and homeliness, always ridiculous, yet\r\nhow sublime, thought Mrs Dalloway, remembering Kensington Gardens and\r\nthe old lady in horn spectacles and being told by Nanny to stop dead\r\nstill and bow to the Queen. The flag flew above the Palace. The King and\r\nQueen were back then. Dick had met her at lunch the other day--a\r\nthoroughly nice woman. It matters so much to the poor, thought Clarissa,\r\nand to the soldiers. A man in bronze stood heroically on a pedestal with\r\na gun on her left hand side--the South African war. It matters, thought\r\nMrs Dalloway walking towards Buckingham Palace. There it stood\r\nfour-square, in the broad sunshine, uncompromising, plain. But it was\r\ncharacter she thought; something inborn in the race; what Indians\r\nrespected. The Queen went to hospitals, opened bazaars--the Queen of\r\nEngland, thought Clarissa, looking at the Palace. Already at this hour a\r\nmotor car passed out at the gates; soldiers saluted; the gates were\r\nshut. And Clarissa, crossing the road, entered the Park, holding herself\r\nupright.\r\n\r\nJune had drawn out every leaf on the trees. The mothers of Westminster\r\nwith mottled breasts gave suck to their young. Quite respectable girls\r\nlay stretched on the grass. An elderly man, stooping very stiffly,\r\npicked up a crumpled paper, spread it out flat and flung it away. How\r\nhorrible! Last night at the Embassy Sir Dighton had said \"If I want a\r\nfellow to hold my horse, I have only to put up my hand.\" But the\r\nreligious question is far more serious than the economic, Sir Dighton\r\nhad said, which she thought extraordinarily interesting, from a man like\r\nSir Dighton. \"Oh, the country will never know what it has lost\" he had\r\nsaid, talking, of his own accord, about dear Jack Stewart.\r\n\r\nShe mounted the little hill lightly. The air stirred with energy.\r\nMessages were passing from the Fleet to the Admiralty. Piccadilly and\r\nArlington Street and the Mall seemed to chafe the very air in the Park\r\nand lift its leaves hotly, brilliantly, upon waves of that divine\r\nvitality which Clarissa loved. To ride; to dance; she had adored all\r\nthat. Or going long walks in the country, talking, about books, what to\r\ndo with one's life, for young people were amazingly priggish--oh, the\r\nthings one had said! But one had conviction. Middle age is the devil.\r\nPeople like Jack'll never know that, she thought; for he never once\r\nthought of death, never, they said, knew he was dying. And now can never\r\nmourn--how did it go?--a head grown grey. . . . From the contagion of\r\nthe world's slow stain . . . have drunk their cup a round or two before.\r\n. . . From the contagion of the world's slow stain! She held herself\r\nupright.\r\n\r\nBut how Jack would have shouted! Quoting Shelley, in Piccadilly! \"You\r\nwant a pin,\" he would have said. He hated frumps. \"My God Clarissa! My\r\nGod Clarissa!\"--she could hear him now at the Devonshire House party,\r\nabout poor Sylvia Hunt in her amber necklace and that dowdy old silk.\r\nClarissa held herself upright for she had spoken aloud and now she was\r\nin Piccadilly, passing the house with the slender green columns, and the\r\nbalconies; passing club windows full of newspapers; passing old Lady\r\nBurdett Coutts' house where the glazed white parrot used to hang; and\r\nDevonshire House, without its gilt leopards; and Claridge's, where she\r\nmust remember Dick wanted her to leave a card on Mrs Jepson or she would\r\nbe gone. Rich Americans can be very charming. There was St James palace;\r\nlike a child's game with bricks; and now--she had passed Bond\r\nStreet--she was by Hatchard's book shop. The stream was\r\nendless--endless--endless. Lords, Ascot, Hurlingham--what was it? What a\r\nduck, she thought, looking at the frontispiece of some book of memoirs\r\nspread wide in the bow window, Sir Joshua perhaps or Romney; arch,\r\nbright, demure; the sort of girl--like her own Elizabeth--the only\r\n_real_ sort of girl. And there was that absurd book, Soapy Sponge, which\r\nJim used to quote by the yard; and Shakespeare's Sonnets. She knew them\r\nby heart. Phil and she had argued all day about the Dark Lady, and Dick\r\nhad said straight out at dinner that night that he had never heard of\r\nher. Really, she had married him for that! He had never read\r\nShakespeare! There must be some little cheap book she could buy for\r\nMilly--Cranford of course! Was there ever anything so enchanting as the\r\ncow in petticoats? If only people had that sort of humour, that sort of\r\nself-respect now, thought Clarissa, for she remembered the broad pages;\r\nthe sentences ending; the characters--how one talked about them as if\r\nthey were real. For all the great things one must go to the past, she\r\nthought. From the contagion of the world's slow stain. . . . Fear no\r\nmore the heat o' the sun. . . . And now can never mourn, can never\r\nmourn, she repeated, her eyes straying over the window; for it ran in\r\nher head; the test of great poetry; the moderns had never written\r\nanything one wanted to read about death, she thought; and turned.\r\n\r\nOmnibuses joined motor cars; motor cars vans; vans taxicabs; taxicabs\r\nmotor cars--here was an open motor car with a girl, alone. Up till four,\r\nher feet tingling, I know, thought Clarissa, for the girl looked washed\r\nout, half asleep, in the corner of the car after the dance. And another\r\ncar came; and another. No! No! No! Clarissa smiled good-naturedly. The\r\nfat lady had taken every sort of trouble, but diamonds! orchids! at this\r\nhour of the morning! No! No! No! The excellent policeman would, when the\r\ntime came, hold up his hand. Another motor car passed. How utterly\r\nunattractive! Why should a girl of that age paint black round her eyes?\r\nAnd a young man, with a girl, at this hour, when the country--The\r\nadmirable policeman raised his hand and Clarissa acknowledging his sway,\r\ntaking her time, crossed, walked towards Bond Street; saw the narrow\r\ncrooked street, the yellow banners; the thick notched telegraph wires\r\nstretched across the sky.\r\n\r\nA hundred years ago her great-great-grandfather, Seymour Parry, who ran\r\naway with Conway's daughter, had walked down Bond Street. Down Bond\r\nStreet the Parrys had walked for a hundred years, and might have met the\r\nDalloways (Leighs on the mother's side) going up. Her father got his\r\nclothes from Hill's. There was a roll of cloth in the window, and here\r\njust one jar on a black table, incredibly expensive; like the thick pink\r\nsalmon on the ice block at the fishmonger's. The jewels were\r\nexquisite--pink and orange stars, paste, Spanish, she thought, and\r\nchains of old gold; starry buckles, little brooches which had been worn\r\non sea green satin by ladies with high head-dresses. But no good\r\nlooking! One must economize. She must go on past the picture dealer's\r\nwhere one of the odd French pictures hung, as if people had thrown\r\nconfetti--pink and blue--for a joke. If you had lived with pictures (and\r\nit's the same with books and music) thought Clarissa, passing the\r\nAeolian Hall, you can't be taken in by a joke.\r\n\r\nThe river of Bond Street was clogged. There, like a Queen at a\r\ntournament, raised, regal, was Lady Bexborough. She sat in her carriage,\r\nupright, alone, looking through her glasses. The white glove was loose\r\nat her wrist. She was in black, quite shabby, yet, thought Clarissa, how\r\nextraordinarily it tells, breeding, self-respect, never saying a word\r\ntoo much or letting people gossip; an astonishing friend; no one can\r\npick a hole in her after all these years, and now, there she is, thought\r\nClarissa, passing the Countess who waited powdered, perfectly still, and\r\nClarissa would have given anything to be like that, the mistress of\r\nClarefield, talking politics, like a man. But she never goes anywhere,\r\nthought Clarissa, and it's quite useless to ask her, and the carriage\r\nwent on and Lady Bexborough was borne past like a Queen at a tournament,\r\nthough she had nothing to live for and the old man is failing and they\r\nsay she is sick of it all, thought Clarissa and the tears actually rose\r\nto her eyes as she entered the shop.\r\n\r\n\"Good morning\" said Clarissa in her charming voice. \"Gloves\" she said\r\nwith her exquisite friendliness and putting her bag on the counter\r\nbegan, very slowly, to undo the buttons. \"White gloves\" she said. \"Above\r\nthe elbow\" and she looked straight into the shopwoman's face--but this\r\nwas not the girl she remembered? She looked quite old. \"These really\r\ndon't fit\" said Clarissa. The shop girl looked at them. \"Madame wears\r\nbracelets?\" Clarissa spread out her fingers. \"Perhaps it's my rings.\"\r\nAnd the girl took the grey gloves with her to the end of the counter.\r\n\r\nYes, thought Clarissa, if it's the girl I remember she's twenty years\r\nolder. . . . There was only one other customer, sitting sideways at the\r\ncounter, her elbow poised, her bare hand drooping, vacant; like a figure\r\non a Japanese fan, thought Clarissa, too vacant perhaps, yet some men\r\nwould adore her. The lady shook her head sadly. Again the gloves were\r\ntoo large. She turned round the glass. \"Above the wrist\" she reproached\r\nthe grey-headed woman; who looked and agreed.\r\n\r\nThey waited; a clock ticked; Bond Street hummed, dulled, distant; the\r\nwoman went away holding gloves. \"Above the wrist\" said the lady,\r\nmournfully, raising her voice. And she would have to order chairs, ices,\r\nflowers, and cloak-room tickets, thought Clarissa. The people she didn't\r\nwant would come; the others wouldn't. She would stand by the door. They\r\nsold stockings--silk stockings. A lady is known by her gloves and her\r\nshoes, old Uncle William used to say. And through the hanging silk\r\nstockings quivering silver she looked at the lady, sloping shouldered,\r\nher hand drooping, her bag slipping, her eyes vacantly on the floor. It\r\nwould be intolerable if dowdy women came to her party! Would one have\r\nliked Keats if he had worn red socks? Oh, at last--she drew into the\r\ncounter and it flashed into her mind:\r\n\r\n\"Do you remember before the war you had gloves with pearl buttons?\"\r\n\r\n\"French gloves, Madame?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, they were French\" said Clarissa. The other lady rose very sadly\r\nand took her bag, and looked at the gloves on the counter. But they were\r\nall too large--always too large at the wrist.\r\n\r\n\"With pearl buttons\" said the shop-girl, who looked ever so much older.\r\nShe split the lengths of tissue paper apart on the counter. With pearl\r\nbuttons, thought Clarissa, perfectly simple--how French!\r\n\r\n\"Madame's hands are so slender\" said the shop girl, drawing the glove\r\nfirmly, smoothly, down over her rings. And Clarissa looked at her arm in\r\nthe looking glass. The glove hardly came to the elbow. Were there others\r\nhalf an inch longer? Still it seemed tiresome to bother her--perhaps the\r\none day in the month, thought Clarissa, when it's an agony to stand.\r\n\"Oh, don't bother\" she said. But the gloves were brought.\r\n\r\n\"Don't you get fearfully tired\" she said in her charming voice,\r\n\"standing? When d'you get your holiday?\"\r\n\r\n\"In September, Madame, when we're not so busy.\"\r\n\r\nWhen we're in the country thought Clarissa. Or shooting. She has a\r\nfortnight at Brighton. In some stuffy lodging. The landlady takes the\r\nsugar. Nothing would be easier than to send her to Mrs Lumley's right in\r\nthe country (and it was on the tip of her tongue). But then she\r\nremembered how on their honeymoon Dick had shown her the folly of giving\r\nimpulsively. It was much more important, he said, to get trade with\r\nChina. Of course he was right. And she could feel the girl wouldn't like\r\nto be given things. There she was in her place. So was Dick. Selling\r\ngloves was her job. She had her own sorrows quite separate, \"and now can\r\nnever mourn, can never mourn\" the words ran in her head, \"From the\r\ncontagion of the world's slow stain\" thought Clarissa holding her arm\r\nstiff, for there are moments when it seems utterly futile (the glove was\r\ndrawn off leaving her arm flecked with powder)--simply one doesn't\r\nbelieve, thought Clarissa, any more in God.\r\n\r\nThe traffic suddenly roared; the silk stockings brightened. A\r\ncustomer came in.\r\n\r\n\"White gloves,\" she said, with some ring in her voice that Clarissa\r\nremembered.\r\n\r\nIt used, thought Clarissa, to be so simple. Down down through the air\r\ncame the caw of the rooks. When Sylvia died, hundreds of years ago, the\r\nyew hedges looked so lovely with the diamond webs in the mist before\r\nearly church. But if Dick were to die to-morrow as for believing in\r\nGod--no, she would let the children choose, but for herself, like Lady\r\nBexborough, who opened the bazaar, they say, with the telegram in her\r\nhand--Roden, her favourite, killed--she would go on. But why, if one\r\ndoesn't believe? For the sake of others, she thought, taking the glove\r\nin her hand. This girl would be much more unhappy if she didn't believe.\r\n\r\n\"Thirty shillings\" said the shopwoman. \"No, pardon me Madame,\r\nthirty-five. The French gloves are more.\"\r\n\r\nFor one doesn't live for oneself, thought Clarissa.\r\n\r\nAnd then the other customer took a glove, tugged it, and it split.\r\n\r\n\"There!\" she exclaimed.\r\n\r\n\"A fault of the skin,\" said the grey-headed woman hurriedly.\r\n\"Sometimes a drop of acid in tanning. Try this pair, Madame.\"\r\n\r\n\"But it's an awful swindle to ask two pound ten!\"\r\n\r\nClarissa looked at the lady; the lady looked at Clarissa.\r\n\r\n\"Gloves have never been quite so reliable since the war\" said the\r\nshop-girl, apologizing, to Clarissa.\r\n\r\nBut where had she seen the other lady?--elderly, with a frill under her\r\nchin; wearing a black ribbon for gold eyeglasses; sensual, clever, like\r\na Sargent drawing. How one can tell from a voice when people are in the\r\nhabit, thought Clarissa, of making other people--\"It's a shade too\r\ntight\" she said--obey. The shopwoman went off again. Clarissa was left\r\nwaiting. Fear no more she repeated, playing her finger on the counter.\r\nFear no more the heat o' the sun. Fear no more she repeated. There were\r\nlittle brown spots on her arm. And the girl crawled like a snail. Thou\r\nthy wordly task hast done. Thousands of young men had died that things\r\nmight go on. At last! Half an inch above the elbow; pearl buttons; five\r\nand a quarter. My dear slow coach, thought Clarissa, do you think I can\r\nsit here the whole morning? Now you'll take twenty-five minutes to bring\r\nme my change!\r\n\r\nThere was a violent explosion in the street outside. The shopwomen\r\ncowered behind the counters. But Clarissa, sitting very up-right, smiled\r\nat the other lady. \"Miss Anstruther!\" she exclaimed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's Mrs Dalloway in Bond Street, by Virginia Woolf"

Perhaps you will vote it _the_ best!\r\n\r\n           [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\r\n                       Planet Stories Fall 1947.\r\n         Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\r\n         the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\r\n\r\n\r\nOh, it was to be so jolly! What a game! Such excitement they hadn't\r\nknown in years. The children catapulted this way and that across the\r\ngreen lawns, shouting at each other, holding hands, flying in circles,\r\nclimbing trees, laughing.... Overhead, the rockets flew and beetle-cars\r\nwhispered by on the streets, but the children played on. Such fun, such\r\ntremulous joy, such tumbling and hearty screaming.\r\n\r\nMink ran into the house, all dirt and sweat. For her seven years she\r\nwas loud and strong and definite. Her mother, Mrs. Morris, hardly saw\r\nher as she yanked out drawers and rattled pans and tools into a large\r\nsack.\r\n\r\n\"Heavens, Mink, what's going on?\"\r\n\r\n\"The most exciting game ever!\" gasped Mink, pink-faced.\r\n\r\n\"Stop and get your breath,\" said the mother.\r\n\r\n\"No, I'm all right,\" gasped Mink. \"Okay I take these things, Mom?\"\r\n\r\n\"But don't dent them,\" said Mrs. Morris.\r\n\r\n\"Thank you, thank you!\" cried Mink and boom! she was gone, like a\r\nrocket.\r\n\r\nMrs. Morris surveyed the fleeing tot. \"What's the name of the game?\"\r\n\r\n\"Invasion!\" said Mink. The door slammed.\r\n\r\nIn every yard on the street children brought out knives and forks and\r\npokers and old stove pipes and can-openers.\r\n\r\nIt was an interesting fact that this fury and bustle occurred only\r\namong the younger children. The older ones, those ten years and more\r\ndisdained the affair and marched scornfully off on hikes or played a\r\nmore dignified version of hide-and-seek on their own.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, parents came and went in chromium beetles. Repair men\r\ncame to repair the vacuum elevators in houses, to fix fluttering\r\ntelevision sets or hammer upon stubborn food-delivery tubes. The\r\nadult civilization passed and repassed the busy youngsters, jealous\r\nof the fierce energy of the wild tots, tolerantly amused at their\r\nflourishings, longing to join in themselves.\r\n\r\n\"This and this and _this_,\" said Mink, instructing the others with\r\ntheir assorted spoons and wrenches. \"Do that, and bring _that_ over\r\nhere. No! _Here_, ninnie! Right. Now, get back while I fix this--\"\r\nTongue in teeth, face wrinkled in thought. \"Like that. See?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yayyyy!\" shouted the kids.\r\n\r\nTwelve-year-old Joseph Connors ran up.\r\n\r\n\"Go away,\" said Mink straight at him.\r\n\r\n\"I wanna play,\" said Joseph.\r\n\r\n\"Can't!\" said Mink.\r\n\r\n\"Why not?\"\r\n\r\n\"You'd just make fun of us.\"\r\n\r\n\"Honest, I wouldn't.\"\r\n\r\n\"No. We know _you_. Go away or we'll kick you.\"\r\n\r\nAnother twelve-year-old boy whirred by on little motor-skates. \"Aye,\r\nJoe! Come on! Let them sissies play!\"\r\n\r\nJoseph showed reluctance and a certain wistfulness. \"I _want_ to play,\"\r\nhe said.\r\n\r\n\"You're old,\" said Mink, firmly.\r\n\r\n\"Not _that_ old,\" said Joe sensibly.\r\n\r\n\"You'd only laugh and spoil the Invasion.\"\r\n\r\nThe boy on the motor-skates made a rude lip noise. \"Come on, Joe! Them\r\nand their fairies! Nuts!\"\r\n\r\nJoseph walked off slowly. He kept looking back, all down the block.\r\n\r\nMink was already busy again. She made a kind of apparatus with her\r\ngathered equipment. She had appointed another little girl with a pad\r\nand pencil to take down notes in painful slow scribbles. Their voices\r\nrose and fell in the warm sunlight.\r\n\r\nAll around them the city hummed. The streets were lined with good\r\ngreen and peaceful trees. Only the wind made a conflict across the\r\ncity, across the country, across the continent. In a thousand other\r\ncities there were trees and children and avenues, business men in their\r\nquiet offices taping their voices, or watching televisors. Rockets\r\nhovered like darning needles in the blue sky. There was the universal,\r\nquiet conceit and easiness of men accustomed to peace, quite certain\r\nthere would never be trouble again. Arm in arm, men all over earth\r\nwere a united front. The perfect weapons were held in equal trust by\r\nall nations. A situation of incredibly beautiful balance had been\r\nbrought about. There were no traitors among men, no unhappy ones, no\r\ndisgruntled ones; therefore the world was based upon a stable ground.\r\nSunlight illumined half the world and the trees drowsed in a tide of\r\nwarm air.\r\n\r\nMink's mother, from her upstairs window, gazed down.\r\n\r\nThe children.\r\n\r\nShe looked upon them and shook her head. Well, they'd eat well, sleep\r\nwell, and be in school on Monday. Bless their vigorous little bodies.\r\nShe listened.\r\n\r\nMink talked earnestly to someone near the rose-bush--though there was\r\nno one there.\r\n\r\nThese odd children. And the little girl, what was her name? Anna? Anna\r\ntook notes on a pad. First, Mink asked the rose-bush a question, then\r\ncalled the answer to Anna.\r\n\r\n\"Triangle,\" said Mink.\r\n\r\n\"What's a tri,\" said Anna with difficulty, \"angle?\"\r\n\r\n\"Never mind,\" said Mink.\r\n\r\n\"How you spell it?\" asked Anna.\r\n\r\n\"T-R-I--\" spelled Mink, slowly, then snapped, \"Oh, spell it yourself!\"\r\nShe went on to other words. \"Beam,\" she said.\r\n\r\n\"I haven't got tri,\" said Anna, \"angle down yet!\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, hurry, hurry!\" cried Mink.\r\n\r\nMink's mother leaned out the upstairs window. \"A-N-G-L-E,\" she spelled\r\ndown at Anna.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, thanks, Mrs. Morris,\" said Anna.\r\n\r\n\"Certainly,\" said Mink's mother and withdrew, laughing, to dust the\r\nhall with an electro-duster-magnet.\r\n\r\nThe voices wavered on the shimmery air. \"Beam,\" said Anna. Fading.\r\n\r\n\"Four-nine-seven-A-and-B-and-X,\" said Mink, far away, seriously. \"And a\r\nfork and a string and a--hex-hex-agony ... hexagon_al_!\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAt lunch, Mink gulped milk at one toss and was at the door. Her mother\r\nslapped the table.\r\n\r\n\"You sit right back down,\" commanded Mrs. Morris. \"Hot soup in a\r\nminute.\" She poked a red button on the kitchen butler and ten seconds\r\nlater something landed with a bump in the rubber receiver. Mrs. Morris\r\nopened it, took out a can with a pair of aluminum holders, unsealed it\r\nwith a flick and poured hot soup into a bowl.\r\n\r\nDuring all this, Mink fidgeted. \"Hurry, Mom! This is a matter of life\r\nand death! Aw--!\"\r\n\r\n\"I was the same way at your age. Always life and death. I know.\"\r\n\r\nMink banged away at the soup.\r\n\r\n\"Slow down,\" said Mom.\r\n\r\n\"Can't,\" said Mink. \"Drill's waiting for me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who's Drill? What a peculiar name,\" said Mom.\r\n\r\n\"You don't know him,\" said Mink.\r\n\r\n\"A new boy in the neighborhood?\" asked Mom.\r\n\r\n\"He's new all right,\" said Mink. She started on her second bowl.\r\n\r\n\"Which one is Drill?\" asked Mom.\r\n\r\n\"He's around,\" said Mink, evasively. \"You'll make fun. Everybody pokes\r\nfun. Gee, darn.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is Drill shy?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. No. In a way. Gosh, Mom, I got to run if we want to have the\r\nInvasion!\"\r\n\r\n\"Who's invading what?\"\r\n\r\n\"Martians invading Earth--well, not exactly Martians. They're--I don't\r\nknow. From up.\" She pointed with her spoon.\r\n\r\n\"And _inside_,\" said Mom, touching Mink's feverish brow.\r\n\r\nMink rebelled. \"You're laughing! You'll kill Drill and _every_body.\"\r\n\r\n\"I didn't mean to,\" said Mom. \"Drill's a Martian?\"\r\n\r\n\"No. He's--well--maybe from Jupiter or Saturn or Venus. Anyway, he's\r\nhad a hard time.\"\r\n\r\n\"I imagine.\" Mrs. Morris hid her mouth behind her hand.\r\n\r\n\"They couldn't figure a way to attack earth.\"\r\n\r\n\"We're impregnable,\" said Mom, in mock-seriousness.\r\n\r\n\"That's the word Drill used! Impreg--That was the word, Mom.\"\r\n\r\n\"My, my. Drill's a brilliant little boy. Two-bit words.\"\r\n\r\n\"They couldn't figure a way to attack, Mom. Drill says--he says in\r\norder to make a good fight you got to have a new way of surprising\r\npeople. That way you win. And he says also you got to have help from\r\nyour enemy.\"\r\n\r\n\"A fifth column,\" said Mom.\r\n\r\n\"Yeah. That's what Drill said. And they couldn't figure a way to\r\nsurprise Earth or get help.\"\r\n\r\n\"No wonder. We're pretty darn strong,\" laughed Mom, cleaning up. Mink\r\nsat there, staring at the table, seeing what she was talking about.\r\n\r\n\"Until, one day,\" whispered Mink, melodramatically, \"they thought of\r\nchildren!\"\r\n\r\n\"_Well!_\" said Mrs. Morris brightly.\r\n\r\n\"And they thought of how grown-ups are so busy they never look under\r\nrose-bushes or on lawns!\"\r\n\r\n\"Only for snails and fungus.\"\r\n\r\n\"And then there's something about dim-dims.\"\r\n\r\n\"Dim-dims?\"\r\n\r\n\"Dimens-shuns.\"\r\n\r\n\"Dimensions?\"\r\n\r\n\"Four of 'em! And there's something about kids under nine and\r\nimagination. It's real funny to hear Drill talk.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Morris was tired. \"Well, it must be funny. You're keeping Drill\r\nwaiting now. It's getting late in the day and, if you want to have your\r\nInvasion before your supper bath, you'd better jump.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do I have to take a bath?\" growled Mink.\r\n\r\n\"You do. Why is it children hate water? No matter what age you live in\r\nchildren hate water behind the ears!\"\r\n\r\n\"Drill says I won't have to take baths,\" said Mink.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, he does, does he?\"\r\n\r\n\"He told all the kids that. No more baths. And we can stay up till ten\r\no'clock and go to two televisor shows on Saturday 'stead of one!\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, Mr. Drill better mind his p's and q's. I'll call up his mother\r\nand--\"\r\n\r\nMink went to the door. \"We're having trouble with guys like Pete Britz\r\nand Dale Jerrick. They're growing up. They make fun. They're worse than\r\nparents. They just won't believe in Drill. They're so snooty, cause\r\nthey're growing up. You'd think they'd know better. They were little\r\nonly a coupla years ago. I hate them worst. We'll kill them _first_.\"\r\n\r\n\"Your father and I, last?\"\r\n\r\n\"Drill says you're dangerous. Know why? Cause you don't believe in\r\nMartians! They're going to let _us_ run the world. Well, not just us,\r\nbut the kids over in the next block, too. I might be queen.\" She opened\r\nthe door. \"Mom?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes?\"\r\n\r\n\"What's--lodge ... ick?\"\r\n\r\n\"Logic? Why, dear, logic is knowing what things are true and not true.\"\r\n\r\n\"He _mentioned_ that,\" said Mink. \"And what's im--pres--sion--able?\" It\r\ntook her a minute to say it.\r\n\r\n\"Why, it means--\" Her mother looked at the floor, laughing gently. \"It\r\nmeans--to be a child, dear.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thanks for lunch!\" Mink ran out, then stuck her head back in. \"Mom,\r\nI'll be sure you won't be hurt, much, really!\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, thanks,\" said Mom.\r\n\r\n_Slam_ went the door.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAt four o'clock the audio-visor buzzed. Mrs. Morris flipped the tab.\r\n\"Hello, Helen!\" she said, in welcome.\r\n\r\n\"Hello, Mary. How are things in New York?\"\r\n\r\n\"Fine, how are things in Scranton? You look tired.\"\r\n\r\n\"So do you. The children. Underfoot,\" said Helen.\r\n\r\nMrs. Morris sighed, \"My Mink, too. The super Invasion.\"\r\n\r\nHelen laughed. \"Are your kids playing that game, too?\"\r\n\r\n\"Lord, yes. Tomorrow it'll be geometrical jacks and motorized\r\nhopscotch. Were we this bad when we were kids in '48?\"\r\n\r\n\"Worse. Japs and Nazis. Don't know how my parents put up with me.\r\nTomboy.\"\r\n\r\n\"Parents learn to shut their ears.\"\r\n\r\nA silence.\r\n\r\n\"What's wrong, Mary?\" asked Helen.\r\n\r\nMrs. Morris' eyes were half-closed; her tongue slid slowly,\r\nthoughtfully over her lower lip. \"Eh,\" She jerked. \"Oh, nothing. Just\r\nthought about _that_. Shutting ears and such. Never mind. Where were\r\nwe?\"\r\n\r\n\"My boy Tim's got a crush on some guy named--_Drill_, I think it was.\"\r\n\r\n\"Must be a new password. Mink likes him, too.\"\r\n\r\n\"Didn't know it got as far as New York. Word of mouth, I imagine. Looks\r\nlike a scrap drive. I talked to Josephine and she said her kids--that's\r\nin Boston--are wild on this new game. It's sweeping the country.\"\r\n\r\nAt this moment, Mink trotted into the kitchen to gulp a glass of water.\r\nMrs. Morris turned. \"How're things going?\"\r\n\r\n\"Almost finished,\" said Mink.\r\n\r\n\"Swell,\" said Mrs. Morris. \"What's _that_?\"\r\n\r\n\"A yo-yo,\" said Mink. \"Watch.\"\r\n\r\nShe flung the yo-yo down its string. Reaching the end it--\r\n\r\nIt vanished.\r\n\r\n\"See?\" said Mink. \"Ope!\" Dibbling her finger she made the yo-yo\r\nreappear and zip up the string.\r\n\r\n\"Do that again,\" said her mother.\r\n\r\n\"Can't. Zero hour's five o'clock! 'Bye.\"\r\n\r\nMink exited, zipping her yo-yo.\r\n\r\nOn the audio-visor, Helen laughed. \"Tim brought one of those yo-yo's in\r\nthis morning, but when I got curious he said he wouldn't show it to me,\r\nand when I tried to work it, finally, it wouldn't work.\"\r\n\r\n\"You're not _impressionable_,\" said Mrs. Morris.\r\n\r\n\"What?\"\r\n\r\n\"Never mind. Something I thought of. Can I help you, Helen?\"\r\n\r\n\"I wanted to get that black-and-white cake recipe--\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe hour drowsed by. The day waned. The sun lowered in the peaceful\r\nblue sky. Shadows lengthened on the green lawns. The laughter and\r\nexcitement continued. One little girl ran away, crying.\r\n\r\nMrs. Morris came out the front door.\r\n\r\n\"Mink, was that Peggy Ann crying?\"\r\n\r\nMink was bent over in the yard, near the rose-bush. \"Yeah. She's a\r\nscarebaby. We won't let her play, now. She's getting too old to play. I\r\nguess she grew up all of a sudden.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is that why she cried? Nonsense. Give me a civil answer, young lady,\r\nor inside you come!\"\r\n\r\nMink whirled in consternation, mixed with irritation. \"I can't quit\r\nnow. It's almost time. I'll be good. I'm sorry.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did you hit Peggy Ann?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, honest. You ask her. It was something--well, she's just a\r\nscaredy-pants.\"\r\n\r\nThe ring of children drew in around Mink where she scowled at her work\r\nwith spoons and a kind of square shaped arrangement of hammers and\r\npipes. \"There and there,\" murmured Mink.\r\n\r\n\"What's wrong?\" said Mrs. Morris.\r\n\r\n\"Drill's stuck. Half way. If we could only get him all the way through,\r\nit'll be easier. Then all the others could come through after him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Can I help?\"\r\n\r\n\"No'm, thanks. I'll fix it.\"\r\n\r\n\"All right. I'll call you for your bath in half an hour. I'm tired of\r\nwatching you.\"\r\n\r\nShe went in and sat in the electric-relaxing chair, sipping a little\r\nbeer from a half-empty glass. The chair massaged her back. Children,\r\nchildren. Children and love and hate, side by side. Sometimes children\r\nloved you, hated you, all in half a second. Strange children, did they\r\never forget or forgive the whippings and the harsh, strict words of\r\ncommand? She wondered. How can you ever forget or forgive those over\r\nand above you, those tall and silly dictators?\r\n\r\nTime passed. A curious, waiting silence came upon the street, deepening.\r\n\r\nFive o'clock. A clock sang softly somewhere in the house, in a quiet,\r\nmusical voice, \"Five o'clock ... five o'clock. Time's a wasting. Five\r\no'clock,\" and purred away into silence.\r\n\r\nZero hour.\r\n\r\nMrs. Morris chuckled in her throat. Zero hour.\r\n\r\nA beetle-car hummed into the driveway. Mr. Morris. Mrs. Morris smiled.\r\nMr. Morris got out of the beetle, locked it and called hello to Mink at\r\nher work. Mink ignored him. He laughed and stood for a moment watching\r\nthe children in their business. Then he walked up the front steps.\r\n\r\n\"Hello, darling.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hello, Henry.\"\r\n\r\nShe strained forward on the edge of the chair, listening. The children\r\nwere silent. Too silent.\r\n\r\nHe emptied his pipe, refilled it. \"Swell day. Makes you glad to be\r\nalive.\"\r\n\r\nBuzz.\r\n\r\n\"What's that?\" asked Henry.\r\n\r\n\"I don't know.\" She got up, suddenly, her eyes widening. She was going\r\nto say something. She stopped it. Ridiculous. Her nerves jumped. \"Those\r\nchildren haven't anything dangerous out there, have they?\" she said.\r\n\r\n\"Nothing but pipes and hammers. Why?\"\r\n\r\n\"Nothing electrical?\"\r\n\r\n\"Heck, no,\" said Henry. \"I looked.\"\r\n\r\nShe walked to the kitchen. The buzzing continued. \"Just the same\r\nyou'd better go tell them to quit. It's after five. Tell them--\" Her\r\neyes widened and narrowed. \"Tell them to put off their Invasion until\r\ntomorrow.\" She laughed, nervously.\r\n\r\nThe buzzing grew louder.\r\n\r\n\"What are they up to? I'd better go look, all right.\"\r\n\r\nThe explosion!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe house shook with dull sound. There were other explosions in other\r\nyards on other streets.\r\n\r\nInvoluntarily, Mrs. Morris screamed. \"Up this way!\" she cried,\r\nsenselessly, knowing no sense, no reason. Perhaps she saw something\r\nfrom the corners of her eyes, perhaps she smelled a new odor or heard\r\na new noise. There was no time to argue with Henry to convince him.\r\nLet him think her insane. Yes, insane! Shrieking, she ran upstairs. He\r\nran after her to see what she was up to. \"In the attic!\" she screamed.\r\n\"That's where it is!\" It was only a poor excuse to get him in the attic\r\nin time--oh God, in time!\r\n\r\nAnother explosion outside. The children screamed with delight, as if at\r\na great fireworks display.\r\n\r\n\"It's not in the attic!\" cried Henry. \"It's outside!\"\r\n\r\n\"No, no!\" Wheezing, gasping, she fumbled at the attic door. \"I'll show\r\nyou. Hurry! I'll show you!\"\r\n\r\nThey tumbled into the attic. She slammed the door, locked it, took the\r\nkey, threw it into a far, cluttered corner.\r\n\r\nShe was babbling wild stuff now. It came out of her. All the\r\nsubconscious suspicion and fear that had gathered secretly all\r\nafternoon and fermented like a wine in her. All the little revelations\r\nand knowledges and sense that had bothered her all day and which she\r\nhad logically and carefully and sensibly rejected and censored. Now it\r\nexploded in her and shook her to bits.\r\n\r\n\"There, there,\" she said, sobbing against the door. \"We're safe until\r\ntonight. Maybe we can sneak out, maybe we can escape!\"\r\n\r\nHenry blew up, too, but for another reason. \"Are you crazy? Why'd you\r\nthrow that key away! Damn it, honey!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, yes, I'm crazy, if it helps, but stay here with me!\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know how in hell I _can_ get out!\"\r\n\r\n\"Quiet. They'll hear us. Oh, God, they'll find us soon enough--\"\r\n\r\nBelow them, Mink's voice. The husband stopped. There was a great\r\nuniversal humming and sizzling, a screaming and giggling. Downstairs,\r\nthe audio-televisor buzzed and buzzed insistently, alarmingly,\r\nviolently. _Is that Helen calling?_ thought Mrs. Morris. _And is she\r\ncalling about what I_ think _she's calling about_?\r\n\r\nFootsteps came into the house. Heavy footsteps.\r\n\r\n\"Who's coming in my house?\" demanded Henry, angrily. \"Who's tramping\r\naround down there?\"\r\n\r\nHeavy feet. Twenty, thirty, forty, fifty of them. Fifty persons\r\ncrowding into the house. The humming. The giggling of the children.\r\n\"This way!\" cried Mink, below.\r\n\r\n\"Who's downstairs?\" roared Henry. \"Who's there!\"\r\n\r\n\"Hush, oh, nonononono!\" said his wife, weakly, holding him. \"Please, be\r\nquiet. They might go away.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mom?\" called Mink, \"Dad?\" A pause. \"Where are you?\"\r\n\r\nHeavy footsteps, heavy, heavy, _very_ HEAVY footsteps came up the\r\nstairs. Mink leading them.\r\n\r\n\"Mom?\" A hesitation. \"Dad?\" A waiting, a silence.\r\n\r\nHumming. Footsteps toward the attic. Mink's first.\r\n\r\nThey trembled together in silence in the attic, Mr. and Mrs. Morris.\r\nFor some reason the electric humming, the queer cold light suddenly\r\nvisible under the door crack, the strange odor and the alien sound of\r\neagerness in Mink's voice, finally got through to Henry Morris, too. He\r\nstood, shivering, in the dark silence, his wife beside him.\r\n\r\n\"Mom! Dad!\"\r\n\r\nFootsteps. A little humming sound. The attic lock melted. The door\r\nopened. Mink peered inside, tall blue shadows behind her.\r\n\r\n\"Peek-a-boo,\" said Mink."

    "content": "THE BIG TRIP\r\n       UP YONDER\r\n\r\nBy KURT VONNEGUT, JR.\r\n\r\nIllustrated by KOSSIN\r\n\r\n\r\n    _If it was good enough for your grandfather, forget it ... it is\r\n    much too good for anyone else!_\r\n\r\n\r\nGramps Ford, his chin resting on his hands, his hands on the crook of\r\nhis cane, was staring irascibly at the five-foot television screen that\r\ndominated the room. On the screen, a news commentator was summarizing\r\nthe day's happenings. Every thirty seconds or so, Gramps would jab the\r\nfloor with his cane-tip and shout, \"Hell, we did that a hundred years\r\nago!\"\r\n\r\nEmerald and Lou, coming in from the balcony, where they had been seeking\r\nthat 2185 A.D. rarity--privacy--were obliged to take seats in the back\r\nrow, behind Lou's father and mother, brother and sister-in-law, son and\r\ndaughter-in-law, grandson and wife, granddaughter and husband,\r\ngreat-grandson and wife, nephew and wife, grandnephew and wife,\r\ngreat-grandniece and husband, great-grandnephew and wife--and, of\r\ncourse, Gramps, who was in front of everybody. All save Gramps, who was\r\nsomewhat withered and bent, seemed, by pre-anti-gerasone standards, to\r\nbe about the same age--somewhere in their late twenties or early\r\nthirties. Gramps looked older because he had already reached 70 when\r\nanti-gerasone was invented. He had not aged in the 102 years since.\r\n\r\n\"Meanwhile,\" the commentator was saying, \"Council Bluffs, Iowa, was\r\nstill threatened by stark tragedy. But 200 weary rescue workers have\r\nrefused to give up hope, and continue to dig in an effort to save Elbert\r\nHaggedorn, 183, who has been wedged for two days in a ...\"\r\n\r\n\"I wish he'd get something more cheerful,\" Emerald whispered to Lou.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"Silence!\" cried Gramps. \"Next one shoots off his big bazoo while the\r\nTV's on is gonna find hisself cut off without a dollar--\" his voice\r\nsuddenly softened and sweetened--\"when they wave that checkered flag at\r\nthe Indianapolis Speedway, and old Gramps gets ready for the Big Trip Up\r\nYonder.\"\r\n\r\nHe sniffed sentimentally, while his heirs concentrated desperately on\r\nnot making the slightest sound. For them, the poignancy of the\r\nprospective Big Trip had been dulled somewhat, through having been\r\nmentioned by Gramps about once a day for fifty years.\r\n\r\n\"Dr. Brainard Keyes Bullard,\" continued the commentator, \"President of\r\nWyandotte College, said in an address tonight that most of the world's\r\nills can be traced to the fact that Man's knowledge of himself has not\r\nkept pace with his knowledge of the physical world.\"\r\n\r\n\"_Hell!_\" snorted Gramps. \"We said _that_ a hundred years ago!\"\r\n\r\n\"In Chicago tonight,\" the commentator went on, \"a special celebration is\r\ntaking place in the Chicago Lying-in Hospital. The guest of honor\r\nis Lowell W. Hitz, age zero. Hitz, born this morning, is the\r\ntwenty-five-millionth child to be born in the hospital.\" The commentator\r\nfaded, and was replaced on the screen by young Hitz, who squalled\r\nfuriously.\r\n\r\n\"Hell!\" whispered Lou to Emerald. \"We said that a hundred years ago.\"\r\n\r\n\"I heard that!\" shouted Gramps. He snapped off the television set and\r\nhis petrified descendants stared silently at the screen. \"You, there,\r\nboy--\"\r\n\r\n\"I didn't mean anything by it, sir,\" said Lou, aged 103.\r\n\r\n\"Get me my will. You know where it is. You kids _all_ know where it is.\r\nFetch, boy!\" Gramps snapped his gnarled fingers sharply.\r\n\r\nLou nodded dully and found himself going down the hall, picking his way\r\nover bedding to Gramps' room, the only private room in the Ford\r\napartment. The other rooms were the bathroom, the living room and the\r\nwide windowless hallway, which was originally intended to serve as a\r\ndining area, and which had a kitchenette in one end. Six mattresses and\r\nfour sleeping bags were dispersed in the hallway and living room, and\r\nthe daybed, in the living room, accommodated the eleventh couple, the\r\nfavorites of the moment.\r\n\r\nOn Gramps' bureau was his will, smeared, dog-eared, perforated and\r\nblotched with hundreds of additions, deletions, accusations, conditions,\r\nwarnings, advice and homely philosophy. The document was, Lou reflected,\r\na fifty-year diary, all jammed onto two sheets--a garbled, illegible log\r\nof day after day of strife. This day, Lou would be disinherited for the\r\neleventh time, and it would take him perhaps six months of impeccable\r\nbehavior to regain the promise of a share in the estate. To say nothing\r\nof the daybed in the living room for Em and himself.\r\n\r\n\"Boy!\" called Gramps.\r\n\r\n\"Coming, sir.\" Lou hurried back into the living room and handed Gramps\r\nthe will.\r\n\r\n\"Pen!\" said Gramps.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHe was instantly offered eleven pens, one from each couple.\r\n\r\n\"Not _that_ leaky thing,\" he said, brushing Lou's pen aside. \"Ah,\r\n_there's_ a nice one. Good boy, Willy.\" He accepted Willy's pen. That\r\nwas the tip they had all been waiting for. Willy, then--Lou's\r\nfather--was the new favorite.\r\n\r\nWilly, who looked almost as young as Lou, though he was 142, did a poor\r\njob of concealing his pleasure. He glanced shyly at the daybed, which\r\nwould become his, and from which Lou and Emerald would have to move back\r\ninto the hall, back to the worst spot of all by the bathroom door.\r\n\r\nGramps missed none of the high drama he had authored and he gave his own\r\nfamiliar role everything he had. Frowning and running his finger along\r\neach line, as though he were seeing the will for the first time, he read\r\naloud in a deep portentous monotone, like a bass note on a cathedral\r\norgan.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\"I, Harold D. Ford, residing in Building 257 of Alden Village, New York\r\nCity, Connecticut, do hereby make, publish and declare this to be my\r\nlast Will and Testament, revoking any and all former wills and\r\ncodicils by me at any time heretofore made.\" He blew his nose\r\nimportantly and went on, not missing a word, and repeating many for\r\nemphasis--repeating in particular his ever-more-elaborate specifications\r\nfor a funeral.\r\n\r\nAt the end of these specifications, Gramps was so choked with emotion\r\nthat Lou thought he might have forgotten why he'd brought out the will\r\nin the first place. But Gramps heroically brought his powerful emotions\r\nunder control and, after erasing for a full minute, began to write and\r\nspeak at the same time. Lou could have spoken his lines for him, he had\r\nheard them so often.\r\n\r\n\"I have had many heartbreaks ere leaving this vale of tears for a better\r\nland,\" Gramps said and wrote. \"But the deepest hurt of all has been\r\ndealt me by--\" He looked around the group, trying to remember who the\r\nmalefactor was.\r\n\r\nEveryone looked helpfully at Lou, who held up his hand resignedly.\r\n\r\nGramps nodded, remembering, and completed the sentence--\"my\r\ngreat-grandson, Louis J. Ford.\"\r\n\r\n\"Grandson, sir,\" said Lou.\r\n\r\n\"Don't quibble. You're in deep enough now, young man,\" said Gramps, but\r\nhe made the change. And, from there, he went without a misstep through\r\nthe phrasing of the disinheritance, causes for which were\r\ndisrespectfulness and quibbling.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn the paragraph following, the paragraph that had belonged to everyone\r\nin the room at one time or another, Lou's name was scratched out and\r\nWilly's substituted as heir to the apartment and, the biggest plum of\r\nall, the double bed in the private bedroom.\r\n\r\n\"So!\" said Gramps, beaming. He erased the date at the foot of the will\r\nand substituted a new one, including the time of day. \"Well--time to\r\nwatch the McGarvey Family.\" The McGarvey Family was a television serial\r\nthat Gramps had been following since he was 60, or for a total of 112\r\nyears. \"I can't wait to see what's going to happen next,\" he said.\r\n\r\nLou detached himself from the group and lay down on his bed of pain by\r\nthe bathroom door. Wishing Em would join him, he wondered where she was.\r\n\r\nHe dozed for a few moments, until he was disturbed by someone stepping\r\nover him to get into the bathroom. A moment later, he heard a faint\r\ngurgling sound, as though something were being poured down the washbasin\r\ndrain. Suddenly, it entered his mind that Em had cracked up, that she\r\nwas in there doing something drastic about Gramps.\r\n\r\n\"Em?\" he whispered through the panel. There was no reply, and Lou\r\npressed against the door. The worn lock, whose bolt barely engaged its\r\nsocket, held for a second, then let the door swing inward.\r\n\r\n\"Morty!\" gasped Lou.\r\n\r\nLou's great-grandnephew, Mortimer, who had just married and brought his\r\nwife home to the Ford menage, looked at Lou with consternation and\r\nsurprise. Morty kicked the door shut, but not before Lou had glimpsed\r\nwhat was in his hand--Gramps' enormous economy-size bottle of\r\nanti-gerasone, which had apparently been half-emptied, and which Morty\r\nwas refilling with tap water.\r\n\r\nA moment later, Morty came out, glared defiantly at Lou and brushed past\r\nhim wordlessly to rejoin his pretty bride.\r\n\r\nShocked, Lou didn't know what to do. He couldn't let Gramps take the\r\nmousetrapped anti-gerasone--but, if he warned Gramps about it, Gramps\r\nwould certainly make life in the apartment, which was merely\r\ninsufferable now, harrowing.\r\n\r\nLou glanced into the living room and saw that the Fords, Emerald among\r\nthem, were momentarily at rest, relishing the botches that the McGarveys\r\nhad made of _their_ lives. Stealthily, he went into the bathroom, locked\r\nthe door as well as he could and began to pour the contents of Gramps'\r\nbottle down the drain. He was going to refill it with full-strength\r\nanti-gerasone from the 22 smaller bottles on the shelf.\r\n\r\nThe bottle contained a half-gallon, and its neck was small, so it seemed\r\nto Lou that the emptying would take forever. And the almost\r\nimperceptible smell of anti-gerasone, like Worcestershire sauce, now\r\nseemed to Lou, in his nervousness, to be pouring out into the rest of\r\nthe apartment, through the keyhole and under the door.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe bottle gurgled monotonously. Suddenly, up came the sound of music\r\nfrom the living room and there were murmurs and the scraping of\r\nchair-legs on the floor. \"Thus ends,\" said the television announcer,\r\n\"the 29,121st chapter in the life of your neighbors and mine, the\r\nMcGarveys.\" Footsteps were coming down the hall. There was a knock on\r\nthe bathroom door.\r\n\r\n\"Just a sec,\" Lou cheerily called out. Desperately, he shook the big\r\nbottle, trying to speed up the flow. His palms slipped on the wet glass,\r\nand the heavy bottle smashed on the tile floor.\r\n\r\nThe door was pushed open, and Gramps, dumbfounded, stared at the\r\nincriminating mess.\r\n\r\nLou felt a hideous prickling sensation on his scalp and the back of his\r\nneck. He grinned engagingly through his nausea and, for want of anything\r\nremotely resembling a thought, waited for Gramps to speak.\r\n\r\n\"Well, boy,\" said Gramps at last, \"looks like you've got a little\r\ntidying up to do.\"\r\n\r\nAnd that was all he said. He turned around, elbowed his way through the\r\ncrowd and locked himself in his bedroom.\r\n\r\nThe Fords contemplated Lou in incredulous silence a moment longer, and\r\nthen hurried back to the living room, as though some of his horrible\r\nguilt would taint them, too, if they looked too long. Morty stayed\r\nbehind long enough to give Lou a quizzical, annoyed glance. Then he also\r\nwent into the living room, leaving only Emerald standing in the doorway.\r\n\r\nTears streamed over her cheeks. \"Oh, you poor lamb--_please_ don't look\r\nso awful! It was my fault. I put you up to this with my nagging about\r\nGramps.\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" said Lou, finding his voice, \"really you didn't. Honest, Em, I was\r\njust--\"\r\n\r\n\"You don't have to explain anything to me, hon. I'm on your side, no\r\nmatter what.\" She kissed him on one cheek and whispered in his ear, \"It\r\nwouldn't have been murder, hon. It wouldn't have killed him. It wasn't\r\nsuch a terrible thing to do. It just would have fixed him up so he'd be\r\nable to go any time God decided He wanted him.\"\r\n\r\n\"What's going to happen next, Em?\" said Lou hollowly. \"What's he going\r\nto do?\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nLou and Emerald stayed fearfully awake almost all night, waiting to see\r\nwhat Gramps was going to do. But not a sound came from the sacred\r\nbedroom. Two hours before dawn, they finally dropped off to sleep.\r\n\r\nAt six o'clock, they arose again, for it was time for their generation\r\nto eat breakfast in the kitchenette. No one spoke to them. They had\r\ntwenty minutes in which to eat, but their reflexes were so dulled by the\r\nbad night that they had hardly swallowed two mouthfuls of egg-type\r\nprocessed seaweed before it was time to surrender their places to their\r\nson's generation.\r\n\r\nThen, as was the custom for whoever had been most recently disinherited,\r\nthey began preparing Gramps' breakfast, which would presently be served\r\nto him in bed, on a tray. They tried to be cheerful about it. The\r\ntoughest part of the job was having to handle the honest-to-God eggs and\r\nbacon and oleomargarine, on which Gramps spent so much of the income\r\nfrom his fortune.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said Emerald, \"I'm not going to get all panicky until I'm sure\r\nthere's something to be panicky about.\"\r\n\r\n\"Maybe he doesn't know what it was I busted,\" Lou said hopefully.\r\n\r\n\"Probably thinks it was your watch crystal,\" offered Eddie, their son,\r\nwho was toying apathetically with his buckwheat-type processed sawdust\r\ncakes.\r\n\r\n\"Don't get sarcastic with your father,\" said Em, \"and don't talk with\r\nyour mouth full, either.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'd like to see anybody take a mouthful of this stuff and _not_ say\r\nsomething,\" complained Eddie, who was 73. He glanced at the clock. \"It's\r\ntime to take Gramps his breakfast, you know.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yeah, it is, isn't it?\" said Lou weakly. He shrugged. \"Let's have the\r\ntray, Em.\"\r\n\r\n\"We'll both go.\"\r\n\r\nWalking slowly, smiling bravely, they found a large semi-circle of\r\nlong-faced Fords standing around the bedroom door.\r\n\r\nEm knocked. \"Gramps,\" she called brightly, \"_break_-fast is _rea_-dy.\"\r\n\r\nThere was no reply and she knocked again, harder.\r\n\r\nThe door swung open before her fist. In the middle of the room, the\r\nsoft, deep, wide, canopied bed, the symbol of the sweet by-and-by to\r\nevery Ford, was empty.\r\n\r\nA sense of death, as unfamiliar to the Fords as Zoroastrianism or the\r\ncauses of the Sepoy Mutiny, stilled every voice, slowed every heart.\r\nAwed, the heirs began to search gingerly, under the furniture and behind\r\nthe drapes, for all that was mortal of Gramps, father of the clan.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBut Gramps had left not his Earthly husk but a note, which Lou finally\r\nfound on the dresser, under a paperweight which was a treasured souvenir\r\nfrom the World's Fair of 2000. Unsteadily, Lou read it aloud:\r\n\r\n\"'Somebody who I have sheltered and protected and taught the best I know\r\nhow all these years last night turned on me like a mad dog and diluted\r\nmy anti-gerasone, or tried to. I am no longer a young man. I can no\r\nlonger bear the crushing burden of life as I once could. So, after last\r\nnight's bitter experience, I say good-by. The cares of this world will\r\nsoon drop away like a cloak of thorns and I shall know peace. By the\r\ntime you find this, I will be gone.'\"\r\n\r\n\"Gosh,\" said Willy brokenly, \"he didn't even get to see how the\r\n5000-mile Speedway Race was going to come out.\"\r\n\r\n\"Or the Solar Series,\" Eddie said, with large mournful eyes.\r\n\r\n\"Or whether Mrs. McGarvey got her eyesight back,\" added Morty.\r\n\r\n\"There's more,\" said Lou, and he began reading aloud again: \"'I, Harold\r\nD. Ford, etc., do hereby make, publish and declare this to be my last\r\nWill and Testament, revoking any and all former wills and codicils by me\r\nat any time heretofore made.'\"\r\n\r\n\"No!\" cried Willy. \"Not another one!\"\r\n\r\n\"'I do stipulate,'\" read Lou, \"'that all of my property, of whatsoever\r\nkind and nature, not be divided, but do devise and bequeath it to be\r\nheld in common by my issue, without regard for generation, equally,\r\nshare and share alike.'\"\r\n\r\n\"Issue?\" said Emerald.\r\n\r\nLou included the multitude in a sweep of his hand. \"It means we all own\r\nthe whole damn shootin' match.\"\r\n\r\nEach eye turned instantly to the bed.\r\n\r\n\"Share and share alike?\" asked Morty.\r\n\r\n\"Actually,\" said Willy, who was the oldest one present, \"it's just like\r\nthe old system, where the oldest people head up things with their\r\nheadquarters in here and--\"\r\n\r\n\"I like _that_!\" exclaimed Em. \"Lou owns as much of it as you do, and I\r\nsay it ought to be for the oldest one who's still working. You can\r\nsnooze around here all day, waiting for your pension check, while poor\r\nLou stumbles in here after work, all tuckered out, and--\"\r\n\r\n\"How about letting somebody who's never had _any_ privacy get a little\r\ncrack at it?\" Eddie demanded hotly. \"Hell, you old people had plenty of\r\nprivacy back when you were kids. I was born and raised in the middle of\r\nthat goddamn barracks in the hall! How about--\"\r\n\r\n\"Yeah?\" challenged Morty. \"Sure, you've all had it pretty tough, and my\r\nheart bleeds for you. But try honeymooning in the hall for a real kick.\"\r\n\r\n\"_Silence!_\" shouted Willy imperiously. \"The next person who opens his\r\nmouth spends the next sixth months by the bathroom. Now clear out of my\r\nroom. I want to think.\"\r\n\r\nA vase shattered against the wall, inches above his head.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn the next moment, a free-for-all was under way, with each couple\r\nbattling to eject every other couple from the room. Fighting coalitions\r\nformed and dissolved with the lightning changes of the tactical\r\nsituation. Em and Lou were thrown into the hall, where they organized\r\nothers in the same situation, and stormed back into the room.\r\n\r\nAfter two hours of struggle, with nothing like a decision in sight, the\r\ncops broke in, followed by television cameramen from mobile units.\r\n\r\nFor the next half-hour, patrol wagons and ambulances hauled away Fords,\r\nand then the apartment was still and spacious.\r\n\r\nAn hour later, films of the last stages of the riot were being televised\r\nto 500,000,000 delighted viewers on the Eastern Seaboard.\r\n\r\nIn the stillness of the three-room Ford apartment on the 76th floor of\r\nBuilding 257, the television set had been left on. Once more the air was\r\nfilled with the cries and grunts and crashes of the fray, coming\r\nharmlessly now from the loudspeaker.\r\n\r\nThe battle also appeared on the screen of the television set in the\r\npolice station, where the Fords and their captors watched with\r\nprofessional interest.\r\n\r\nEm and Lou, in adjacent four-by-eight cells, were stretched out\r\npeacefully on their cots.\r\n\r\n\"Em,\" called Lou through the partition, \"you got a washbasin all your\r\nown, too?\"\r\n\r\n\"Sure. Washbasin, bed, light--the works. And we thought _Gramps'_ room\r\nwas something. How long has this been going on?\" She held out her hand.\r\n\"For the first time in forty years, hon, I haven't got the shakes--look\r\nat me!\"\r\n\r\n\"Cross your fingers,\" said Lou. \"The lawyer's going to try to get us a\r\nyear.\"\r\n\r\n\"Gee!\" Em said dreamily. \"I wonder what kind of wires you'd have to pull\r\nto get put away in solitary?\"\r\n\r\n\"All right, pipe down,\" said the turnkey, \"or I'll toss the whole kit\r\nand caboodle of you right out. And first one who lets on to anybody\r\noutside how good jail is ain't never getting back in!\"\r\n\r\nThe prisoners instantly fell silent.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe living room of the apartment darkened for a moment as the riot\r\nscenes faded on the television screen, and then the face of the\r\nannouncer appeared, like the Sun coming from behind a cloud. \"And now,\r\nfriends,\" he said, \"I have a special message from the makers of\r\nanti-gerasone, a message for all you folks over 150. Are you hampered\r\nsocially by wrinkles, by stiffness of joints and discoloration or loss\r\nof hair, all because these things came upon you before anti-gerasone was\r\ndeveloped? Well, if you are, you need no longer suffer, need no longer\r\nfeel different and out of things.\r\n\r\n\"After years of research, medical science has now developed\r\n_Super_-anti-gerasone! In weeks--yes, weeks--you can look, feel and act\r\nas young as your great-great-grandchildren! Wouldn't you pay $5,000 to\r\nbe indistinguishable from everybody else? Well, you don't have to. Safe,\r\ntested _Super_-anti-gerasone costs you only a few dollars a day.\r\n\r\n\"Write now for your free trial carton. Just put your name and address on\r\na dollar postcard, and mail it to '_Super_,' Box 500,000, Schenectady,\r\nN. Y. Have you got that? I'll repeat it. '_Super_,' Box 500,000 ...\"\r\n\r\nUnderlining the announcer's words was the scratching of Gramps' pen, the\r\none Willy had given him the night before. He had come in, a few minutes\r\nearlier, from the Idle Hour Tavern, which commanded a view of Building\r\n257 from across the square of asphalt known as the Alden Village Green.\r\nHe had called a cleaning woman to come straighten the place up, then had\r\nhired the best lawyer in town to get his descendants a conviction, a\r\ngenius who had never gotten a client less than a year and a day. Gramps\r\nhad then moved the daybed before the television screen, so that he could\r\nwatch from a reclining position. It was something he'd dreamed of doing\r\nfor years.\r\n\r\n\"Schen-_ec_-ta-dy,\" murmured Gramps. \"Got it!\" His face had changed\r\nremarkably. His facial muscles seemed to have relaxed, revealing\r\nkindness and equanimity under what had been taut lines of bad temper. It\r\nwas almost as though his trial package of _Super_-anti-gerasone had\r\nalready arrived. When something amused him on television, he smiled\r\neasily, rather than barely managing to lengthen the thin line of his\r\nmouth a millimeter.\r\n\r\nLife was good. He could hardly wait to see what was going to happen\r\nnext.\r\n\r\n                                                  --KURT VONNEGUT, JR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscriber's Note:\r\n\r\n    This etext was produced from _Galaxy Science Fiction_ January 1954.\r\n    Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S.\r\n    copyright on this publication was renewed.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\r\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\r\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\r\npeople in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\r\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\r\nand the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\r\nFoundation\r\n\r\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\r\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\r\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\r\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\r\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\r\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation's principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\r\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\r\nthroughout numerous locations.  Its business office is located at 809\r\nNorth 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887.

Newby\r\n     Chief Executive and Director\r\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\r\n\r\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\r\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\r\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\r\nparticular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\r\nTo donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\r\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\r\nwith anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project\r\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\r\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\r\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\r\n\r\n     www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks."

Outside stood the Optus, his\r\narms folded, his face sunk in gloom.

You people can go out into the veldt\r\nand track it all down again. But when we run out halfway between Mars\r\nand Earth--\"\r\n\r\nThe Optus went off, wordless. Franco joined the first mate at the bottom\r\nof the gangplank.\r\n\r\n\"How's it coming?\" he said. He looked at his watch. \"We got a good\r\nbargain here.\"\r\n\r\nThe mate glanced at him sourly. \"How do you explain that?\"\r\n\r\n\"What's the matter with you? We need it more than they do.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll see you later, Captain.\" The mate threaded his way up the plank,\r\nbetween the long-legged Martian go-birds, into the ship. Franco watched\r\nhim disappear. He was just starting up after him, up the plank toward\r\nthe port, when he saw _it_.\r\n\r\n\"My God!\" He stood staring, his hands on his hips. Peterson was walking\r\nalong the path, his face red, leading _it_ by a string.\r\n\r\n\"I'm sorry, Captain,\" he said, tugging at the string. Franco walked\r\ntoward him.\r\n\r\n\"What is it?\"\r\n\r\nThe wub stood sagging, its great body settling slowly. It was sitting\r\ndown, its eyes half shut. A few flies buzzed about its flank, and it\r\nswitched its tail.\r\n\r\n_It_ sat. There was silence.\r\n\r\n\"It's a wub,\" Peterson said. \"I got it from a native for fifty cents. He\r\nsaid it was a very unusual animal. Very respected.\"\r\n\r\n\"This?\" Franco poked the great sloping side of the wub. \"It's a pig! A\r\nhuge dirty pig!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes sir, it's a pig. The natives call it a wub.\"\r\n\r\n\"A huge pig. It must weigh four hundred pounds.\" Franco grabbed a tuft\r\nof the rough hair. The wub gasped. Its eyes opened, small and moist.\r\nThen its great mouth twitched.\r\n\r\nA tear rolled down the wub's cheek and splashed on the floor.\r\n\r\n\"Maybe it's good to eat,\" Peterson said nervously.\r\n\r\n\"We'll soon find out,\" Franco said.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe wub survived the take-off, sound asleep in the hold of the ship.\r\nWhen they were out in space and everything was running smoothly, Captain\r\nFranco bade his men fetch the wub upstairs so that he might perceive\r\nwhat manner of beast it was.\r\n\r\nThe wub grunted and wheezed, squeezing up the passageway.\r\n\r\n\"Come on,\" Jones grated, pulling at the rope. The wub twisted, rubbing\r\nits skin off on the smooth chrome walls. It burst into the ante-room,\r\ntumbling down in a heap. The men leaped up.\r\n\r\n\"Good Lord,\" French said. \"What is it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Peterson says it's a wub,\" Jones said. \"It belongs to him.\" He kicked\r\nat the wub. The wub stood up unsteadily, panting.\r\n\r\n\"What's the matter with it?\" French came over. \"Is it going to be sick?\"\r\n\r\nThey watched. The wub rolled its eyes mournfully. It gazed around at the\r\nmen.\r\n\r\n\"I think it's thirsty,\" Peterson said. He went to get some water. French\r\nshook his head.\r\n\r\n\"No wonder we had so much trouble taking off. I had to reset all my\r\nballast calculations.\"\r\n\r\nPeterson came back with the water. The wub began to lap gratefully,\r\nsplashing the men.\r\n\r\nCaptain Franco appeared at the door.\r\n\r\n\"Let's have a look at it.\" He advanced, squinting critically. \"You got\r\nthis for fifty cents?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir,\" Peterson said. \"It eats almost anything. I fed it on grain\r\nand it liked that. And then potatoes, and mash, and scraps from the\r\ntable, and milk. It seems to enjoy eating. After it eats it lies down\r\nand goes to sleep.\"\r\n\r\n\"I see,\" Captain Franco said. \"Now, as to its taste. That's the real\r\nquestion. I doubt if there's much point in fattening it up any more. It\r\nseems fat enough to me already. Where's the cook? I want him here. I\r\nwant to find out--\"\r\n\r\nThe wub stopped lapping and looked up at the Captain.\r\n\r\n\"Really, Captain,\" the wub said. \"I suggest we talk of other matters.\"\r\n\r\nThe room was silent.\r\n\r\n\"What was that?\" Franco said. \"Just now.\"\r\n\r\n\"The wub, sir,\" Peterson said. \"It spoke.\"\r\n\r\nThey all looked at the wub.\r\n\r\n\"What did it say? What did it say?\"\r\n\r\n\"It suggested we talk about other things.\"\r\n\r\nFranco walked toward the wub. He went all around it, examining it from\r\nevery side. Then he came back over and stood with the men.\r\n\r\n\"I wonder if there's a native inside it,\" he said thoughtfully. \"Maybe\r\nwe should open it up and have a look.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, goodness!\" the wub cried. \"Is that all you people can think of,\r\nkilling and cutting?\"\r\n\r\nFranco clenched his fists. \"Come out of there! Whoever you are, come\r\nout!\"\r\n\r\nNothing stirred. The men stood together, their faces blank, staring at\r\nthe wub. The wub swished its tail. It belched suddenly.\r\n\r\n\"I beg your pardon,\" the wub said.\r\n\r\n\"I don't think there's anyone in there,\" Jones said in a low voice. They\r\nall looked at each other.\r\n\r\nThe cook came in.\r\n\r\n\"You wanted me, Captain?\" he said. \"What's this thing?\"\r\n\r\n\"This is a wub,\" Franco said. \"It's to be eaten. Will you measure it and\r\nfigure out--\"\r\n\r\n\"I think we should have a talk,\" the wub said. \"I'd like to discuss this\r\nwith you, Captain, if I might. I can see that you and I do not agree on\r\nsome basic issues.\"\r\n\r\nThe Captain took a long time to answer. The wub waited good-naturedly,\r\nlicking the water from its jowls.\r\n\r\n\"Come into my office,\" the Captain said at last. He turned and walked\r\nout of the room. The wub rose and padded after him. The men watched it\r\ngo out. They heard it climbing the stairs.\r\n\r\n\"I wonder what the outcome will be,\" the cook said. \"Well, I'll be in\r\nthe kitchen. Let me know as soon as you hear.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sure,\" Jones said. \"Sure.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe wub eased itself down in the corner with a sigh. \"You must forgive\r\nme,\" it said. \"I'm afraid I'm addicted to various forms of relaxation.\r\nWhen one is as large as I--\"\r\n\r\nThe Captain nodded impatiently. He sat down at his desk and folded his\r\nhands.\r\n\r\n\"All right,\" he said. \"Let's get started. You're a wub? Is that\r\ncorrect?\"\r\n\r\nThe wub shrugged. \"I suppose so. That's what they call us, the natives,\r\nI mean. We have our own term.\"\r\n\r\n\"And you speak English? You've been in contact with Earthmen before?\"\r\n\r\n\"No.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then how do you do it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Speak English? Am I speaking English? I'm not conscious of speaking\r\nanything in particular. I examined your mind--\"\r\n\r\n\"My mind?\"\r\n\r\n\"I studied the contents, especially the semantic warehouse, as I refer\r\nto it--\"\r\n\r\n\"I see,\" the Captain said. \"Telepathy. Of course.\"\r\n\r\n\"We are a very old race,\" the wub said. \"Very old and very ponderous. It\r\nis difficult for us to move around. You can appreciate that anything so\r\nslow and heavy would be at the mercy of more agile forms of life. There\r\nwas no use in our relying on physical defenses. How could we win? Too\r\nheavy to run, too soft to fight, too good-natured to hunt for game--\"\r\n\r\n\"How do you live?\"\r\n\r\n\"Plants. Vegetables. We can eat almost anything. We're very catholic.\r\nTolerant, eclectic, catholic. We live and let live. That's how we've\r\ngotten along.\"\r\n\r\nThe wub eyed the Captain.\r\n\r\n\"And that's why I so violently objected to this business about having me\r\nboiled. I could see the image in your mind--most of me in the frozen\r\nfood locker, some of me in the kettle, a bit for your pet cat--\"\r\n\r\n\"So you read minds?\" the Captain said. \"How interesting. Anything else?\r\nI mean, what else can you do along those lines?\"\r\n\r\n\"A few odds and ends,\" the wub said absently, staring around the room.\r\n\"A nice apartment you have here, Captain. You keep it quite neat. I\r\nrespect life-forms that are tidy. Some Martian birds are quite tidy.\r\nThey throw things out of their nests and sweep them--\"\r\n\r\n\"Indeed.\" The Captain nodded. \"But to get back to the problem--\"\r\n\r\n\"Quite so. You spoke of dining on me. The taste, I am told, is good. A\r\nlittle fatty, but tender. But how can any lasting contact be established\r\nbetween your people and mine if you resort to such barbaric attitudes?\r\nEat me? Rather you should discuss questions with me, philosophy, the\r\narts--\"\r\n\r\nThe Captain stood up. \"Philosophy. It might interest you to know that we\r\nwill be hard put to find something to eat for the next month. An\r\nunfortunate spoilage--\"\r\n\r\n\"I know.\" The wub nodded. \"But wouldn't it be more in accord with your\r\nprinciples of democracy if we all drew straws, or something along that\r\nline? After all, democracy is to protect the minority from just such\r\ninfringements. Now, if each of us casts one vote--\"\r\n\r\nThe Captain walked to the door.\r\n\r\n\"Nuts to you,\" he said. He opened the door. He opened his mouth.\r\n\r\nHe stood frozen, his mouth wide, his eyes staring, his fingers still on\r\nthe knob.\r\n\r\nThe wub watched him. Presently it padded out of the room, edging past\r\nthe Captain. It went down the hall, deep in meditation.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe room was quiet.\r\n\r\n\"So you see,\" the wub said, \"we have a common myth. Your mind contains\r\nmany familiar myth symbols. Ishtar, Odysseus--\"\r\n\r\nPeterson sat silently, staring at the floor. He shifted in his chair.\r\n\r\n\"Go on,\" he said. \"Please go on.\"\r\n\r\n\"I find in your Odysseus a figure common to the mythology of most\r\nself-conscious races. As I interpret it, Odysseus wanders as an\r\nindividual, aware of himself as such. This is the idea of separation, of\r\nseparation from family and country. The process of individuation.\"\r\n\r\n\"But Odysseus returns to his home.\" Peterson looked out the port window,\r\nat the stars, endless stars, burning intently in the empty universe.\r\n\"Finally he goes home.\"\r\n\r\n\"As must all creatures. The moment of separation is a temporary period,\r\na brief journey of the soul. It begins, it ends. The wanderer returns to\r\nland and race....\"\r\n\r\nThe door opened. The wub stopped, turning its great head.\r\n\r\nCaptain Franco came into the room, the men behind him. They hesitated at\r\nthe door.\r\n\r\n\"Are you all right?\" French said.\r\n\r\n\"Do you mean me?\" Peterson said, surprised. \"Why me?\"\r\n\r\nFranco lowered his gun. \"Come over here,\" he said to Peterson. \"Get up\r\nand come here.\"\r\n\r\nThere was silence.\r\n\r\n\"Go ahead,\" the wub said. \"It doesn't matter.\"\r\n\r\nPeterson stood up. \"What for?\"\r\n\r\n\"It's an order.\"\r\n\r\nPeterson walked to the door. French caught his arm.\r\n\r\n\"What's going on?\" Peterson wrenched loose. \"What's the matter with\r\nyou?\"\r\n\r\nCaptain Franco moved toward the wub. The wub looked up from where it lay\r\nin the corner, pressed against the wall.\r\n\r\n\"It is interesting,\" the wub said, \"that you are obsessed with the idea\r\nof eating me. I wonder why.\"\r\n\r\n\"Get up,\" Franco said.\r\n\r\n\"If you wish.\" The wub rose, grunting. \"Be patient. It is difficult for\r\nme.\" It stood, gasping, its tongue lolling foolishly.\r\n\r\n\"Shoot it now,\" French said.\r\n\r\n\"For God's sake!\" Peterson exclaimed. Jones turned to him quickly, his\r\neyes gray with fear.\r\n\r\n\"You didn't see him--like a statue, standing there, his mouth open. If\r\nwe hadn't come down, he'd still be there.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who? The Captain?\" Peterson stared around. \"But he's all right now.\"\r\n\r\nThey looked at the wub, standing in the middle of the room, its great\r\nchest rising and falling.\r\n\r\n\"Come on,\" Franco said. \"Out of the way.\"\r\n\r\nThe men pulled aside toward the door.\r\n\r\n\"You are quite afraid, aren't you?\" the wub said. \"Have I done anything\r\nto you? I am against the idea of hurting. All I have done is try to\r\nprotect myself. Can you expect me to rush eagerly to my death? I am a\r\nsensible being like yourselves. I was curious to see your ship, learn\r\nabout you. I suggested to the native--\"\r\n\r\nThe gun jerked.\r\n\r\n\"See,\" Franco said. \"I thought so.\"\r\n\r\nThe wub settled down, panting. It put its paw out, pulling its tail\r\naround it.\r\n\r\n\"It is very warm,\" the wub said. \"I understand that we are close to the\r\njets. Atomic power. You have done many wonderful things with\r\nit--technically. Apparently, your scientific hierarchy is not equipped\r\nto solve moral, ethical--\"\r\n\r\nFranco turned to the men, crowding behind him, wide-eyed, silent.\r\n\r\n\"I'll do it. You can watch.\"\r\n\r\nFrench nodded. \"Try to hit the brain. It's no good for eating. Don't hit\r\nthe chest. If the rib cage shatters, we'll have to pick bones out.\"\r\n\r\n\"Listen,\" Peterson said, licking his lips. \"Has it done anything? What\r\nharm has it done? I'm asking you. And anyhow, it's still mine. You have\r\nno right to shoot it. It doesn't belong to you.\"\r\n\r\nFranco raised his gun.\r\n\r\n\"I'm going out,\" Jones said, his face white and sick. \"I don't want to\r\nsee it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Me, too,\" French said. The men straggled out, murmuring. Peterson\r\nlingered at the door.\r\n\r\n\"It was talking to me about myths,\" he said. \"It wouldn't hurt anyone.\"\r\n\r\nHe went outside.\r\n\r\nFranco walked toward the wub. The wub looked up slowly. It swallowed.\r\n\r\n\"A very foolish thing,\" it said. \"I am sorry that you want to do it.\r\nThere was a parable that your Saviour related--\"\r\n\r\nIt stopped, staring at the gun.\r\n\r\n\"Can you look me in the eye and do it?\" the wub said. \"Can you do that?\"\r\n\r\nThe Captain gazed down. \"I can look you in the eye,\" he said. \"Back on\r\nthe farm we had hogs, dirty razor-back hogs. I can do it.\"\r\n\r\nStaring down at the wub, into the gleaming, moist eyes, he pressed the\r\ntrigger.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe taste was excellent.\r\n\r\nThey sat glumly around the table, some of them hardly eating at all. The\r\nonly one who seemed to be enjoying himself was Captain Franco.\r\n\r\n\"More?\" he said, looking around. \"More? And some wine, perhaps.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not me,\" French said. \"I think I'll go back to the chart room.\"\r\n\r\n\"Me, too.\" Jones stood up, pushing his chair back. \"I'll see you later.\"\r\n\r\nThe Captain watched them go. Some of the others excused themselves.\r\n\r\n\"What do you suppose the matter is?\" the Captain said. He turned to\r\nPeterson. Peterson sat staring down at his plate, at the potatoes, the\r\ngreen peas, and at the thick slab of tender, warm meat.\r\n\r\nHe opened his mouth. No sound came.\r\n\r\nThe Captain put his hand on Peterson's shoulder.\r\n\r\n\"It is only organic matter, now,\" he said. \"The life essence is gone.\"\r\nHe ate, spooning up the gravy with some bread. \"I, myself, love to eat.\r\nIt is one of the greatest things that a living creature can enjoy.\r\nEating, resting, meditation, discussing things.\"\r\n\r\nPeterson nodded. Two more men got up and went out. The Captain drank\r\nsome water and sighed.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" he said. \"I must say that this was a very enjoyable meal. All\r\nthe reports I had heard were quite true--the taste of wub. Very fine.\r\nBut I was prevented from enjoying this pleasure in times past.\"\r\n\r\nHe dabbed at his lips with his napkin and leaned back in his chair.\r\nPeterson stared dejectedly at the table.\r\n\r\nThe Captain watched him intently. He leaned over.\r\n\r\n\"Come, come,\" he said. \"Cheer up! Let's discuss things.\"\r\n\r\nHe smiled.\r\n\r\n\"As I was saying before I was interrupted, the role of Odysseus in the\r\nmyths--\"\r\n\r\nPeterson jerked up, staring.\r\n\r\n\"To go on,\" the Captain said. \"Odysseus, as I understand him--\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscriber's Note:\r\n\r\n    This etext was produced from _Planet Stories_ July 1952.

Stockton\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the very olden time there lived a semi-barbaric king, whose ideas,\r\nthough somewhat polished and sharpened by the progressiveness of\r\ndistant Latin neighbors, were still large, florid, and untrammeled, as\r\nbecame the half of him which was barbaric. He was a man of exuberant\r\nfancy, and, withal, of an authority so irresistible that, at his will,\r\nhe turned his varied fancies into facts. He was greatly given to\r\nself-communing, and, when he and himself agreed upon anything, the\r\nthing was done.  When every member of his domestic and political\r\nsystems moved smoothly in its appointed course, his nature was bland\r\nand genial; but, whenever there was a little hitch, and some of his\r\norbs got out of their orbits, he was blander and more genial still, for\r\nnothing pleased him so much as to make the crooked straight and crush\r\ndown uneven places.\r\n\r\nAmong the borrowed notions by which his barbarism had become semified\r\nwas that of the public arena, in which, by exhibitions of manly and\r\nbeastly valor, the minds of his subjects were refined and cultured.\r\n\r\nBut even here the exuberant and barbaric fancy asserted itself. The\r\narena of the king was built, not to give the people an opportunity of\r\nhearing the rhapsodies of dying gladiators, nor to enable them to view\r\nthe inevitable conclusion of a conflict between religious opinions and\r\nhungry jaws, but for purposes far better adapted to widen and develop\r\nthe mental energies of the people. This vast amphitheater, with its\r\nencircling galleries, its mysterious vaults, and its unseen passages,\r\nwas an agent of poetic justice, in which crime was punished, or virtue\r\nrewarded, by the decrees of an impartial and incorruptible chance.\r\n\r\nWhen a subject was accused of a crime of sufficient importance to\r\ninterest the king, public notice was given that on an appointed day the\r\nfate of the accused person would be decided in the king's arena, a\r\nstructure which well deserved its name, for, although its form and plan\r\nwere borrowed from afar, its purpose emanated solely from the brain of\r\nthis man, who, every barleycorn a king, knew no tradition to which he\r\nowed more allegiance than pleased his fancy, and who ingrafted on every\r\nadopted form of human thought and action the rich growth of his\r\nbarbaric idealism.\r\n\r\nWhen all the people had assembled in the galleries, and the king,\r\nsurrounded by his court, sat high up on his throne of royal state on\r\none side of the arena, he gave a signal, a door beneath him opened, and\r\nthe accused subject stepped out into the amphitheater. Directly\r\nopposite him, on the other side of the inclosed space, were two doors,\r\nexactly alike and side by side. It was the duty and the privilege of\r\nthe person on trial to walk directly to these doors and open one of\r\nthem. He could open either door he pleased; he was subject to no\r\nguidance or influence but that of the aforementioned impartial and\r\nincorruptible chance. If he opened the one, there came out of it a\r\nhungry tiger, the fiercest and most cruel that could be procured, which\r\nimmediately sprang upon him and tore him to pieces as a punishment for\r\nhis guilt. The moment that the case of the criminal was thus decided,\r\ndoleful iron bells were clanged, great wails went up from the hired\r\nmourners posted on the outer rim of the arena, and the vast audience,\r\nwith bowed heads and downcast hearts, wended slowly their homeward way,\r\nmourning greatly that one so young and fair, or so old and respected,\r\nshould have merited so dire a fate.\r\n\r\nBut, if the accused person opened the other door, there came forth from\r\nit a lady, the most suitable to his years and station that his majesty\r\ncould select among his fair subjects, and to this lady he was\r\nimmediately married, as a reward of his innocence. It mattered not that\r\nhe might already possess a wife and family, or that his affections\r\nmight be engaged upon an object of his own selection; the king allowed\r\nno such subordinate arrangements to interfere with his great scheme of\r\nretribution and reward. The exercises, as in the other instance, took\r\nplace immediately, and in the arena. Another door opened beneath the\r\nking, and a priest, followed by a band of choristers, and dancing\r\nmaidens blowing joyous airs on golden horns and treading an epithalamic\r\nmeasure, advanced to where the pair stood, side by side, and the\r\nwedding was promptly and cheerily solemnized. Then the gay brass bells\r\nrang forth their merry peals, the people shouted glad hurrahs, and the\r\ninnocent man, preceded by children strewing flowers on his path, led\r\nhis bride to his home.\r\n\r\nThis was the king's semi-barbaric method of administering justice. Its\r\nperfect fairness is obvious. The criminal could not know out of which\r\ndoor would come the lady; he opened either he pleased, without having\r\nthe slightest idea whether, in the next instant, he was to be devoured\r\nor married. On some occasions the tiger came out of one door, and on\r\nsome out of the other. The decisions of this tribunal were not only\r\nfair, they were positively determinate: the accused person was\r\ninstantly punished if he found himself guilty, and, if innocent, he was\r\nrewarded on the spot, whether he liked it or not. There was no escape\r\nfrom the judgments of the king's arena.\r\n\r\nThe institution was a very popular one. When the people gathered\r\ntogether on one of the great trial days, they never knew whether they\r\nwere to witness a bloody slaughter or a hilarious wedding.  This\r\nelement of uncertainty lent an interest to the occasion which it could\r\nnot otherwise have attained. Thus, the masses were entertained and\r\npleased, and the thinking part of the community could bring no charge\r\nof unfairness against this plan, for did not the accused person have\r\nthe whole matter in his own hands?\r\n\r\nThis semi-barbaric king had a daughter as blooming as his most florid\r\nfancies, and with a soul as fervent and imperious as his own. As is\r\nusual in such cases, she was the apple of his eye, and was loved by him\r\nabove all humanity. Among his courtiers was a young man of that\r\nfineness of blood and lowness of station common to the conventional\r\nheroes of romance who love royal maidens. This royal maiden was well\r\nsatisfied with her lover, for he was handsome and brave to a degree\r\nunsurpassed in all this kingdom, and she loved him with an ardor that\r\nhad enough of barbarism in it to make it exceedingly warm and strong.\r\nThis love affair moved on happily for many months, until one day the\r\nking happened to discover its existence. He did not hesitate nor waver\r\nin regard to his duty in the premises. The youth was immediately cast\r\ninto prison, and a day was appointed for his trial in the king's arena.\r\nThis, of course, was an especially important occasion, and his majesty,\r\nas well as all the people, was greatly interested in the workings and\r\ndevelopment of this trial. Never before had such a case occurred; never\r\nbefore had a subject dared to love the daughter of the king. In after\r\nyears such things became commonplace enough, but then they were in no\r\nslight degree novel and startling.\r\n\r\nThe tiger-cages of the kingdom were searched for the most savage and\r\nrelentless beasts, from which the fiercest monster might be selected\r\nfor the arena; and the ranks of maiden youth and beauty throughout the\r\nland were carefully surveyed by competent judges in order that the\r\nyoung man might have a fitting bride in case fate did not determine for\r\nhim a different destiny. Of course, everybody knew that the deed with\r\nwhich the accused was charged had been done. He had loved the princess,\r\nand neither he, she, nor any one else, thought of denying the fact; but\r\nthe king would not think of allowing any fact of this kind to interfere\r\nwith the workings of the tribunal, in which he took such great delight\r\nand satisfaction. No matter how the affair turned out, the youth would\r\nbe disposed of, and the king would take an aesthetic pleasure in\r\nwatching the course of events, which would determine whether or not the\r\nyoung man had done wrong in allowing himself to love the princess.\r\n\r\nThe appointed day arrived. From far and near the people gathered, and\r\nthronged the great galleries of the arena, and crowds, unable to gain\r\nadmittance, massed themselves against its outside walls.  The king and\r\nhis court were in their places, opposite the twin doors, those fateful\r\nportals, so terrible in their similarity.\r\n\r\nAll was ready. The signal was given. A door beneath the royal party\r\nopened, and the lover of the princess walked into the arena.  Tall,\r\nbeautiful, fair, his appearance was greeted with a low hum of\r\nadmiration and anxiety. Half the audience had not known so grand a\r\nyouth had lived among them. No wonder the princess loved him! What a\r\nterrible thing for him to be there!\r\n\r\nAs the youth advanced into the arena he turned, as the custom was, to\r\nbow to the king, but he did not think at all of that royal personage.\r\nHis eyes were fixed upon the princess, who sat to the right of her\r\nfather. Had it not been for the moiety of barbarism in her nature it is\r\nprobable that lady would not have been there, but her intense and\r\nfervid soul would not allow her to be absent on an occasion in which\r\nshe was so terribly interested. From the moment that the decree had\r\ngone forth that her lover should decide his fate in the king's arena,\r\nshe had thought of nothing, night or day, but this great event and the\r\nvarious subjects connected with it. Possessed of more power, influence,\r\nand force of character than any one who had ever before been interested\r\nin such a case, she had done what no other person had done,--she had\r\npossessed herself of the secret of the doors. She knew in which of the\r\ntwo rooms, that lay behind those doors, stood the cage of the tiger,\r\nwith its open front, and in which waited the lady.  Through these thick\r\ndoors, heavily curtained with skins on the inside, it was impossible\r\nthat any noise or suggestion should come from within to the person who\r\nshould approach to raise the latch of one of them. But gold, and the\r\npower of a woman's will, had brought the secret to the princess.\r\n\r\nAnd not only did she know in which room stood the lady ready to emerge,\r\nall blushing and radiant, should her door be opened, but she knew who\r\nthe lady was. It was one of the fairest and loveliest of the damsels of\r\nthe court who had been selected as the reward of the accused youth,\r\nshould he be proved innocent of the crime of aspiring to one so far\r\nabove him; and the princess hated her. Often had she seen, or imagined\r\nthat she had seen, this fair creature throwing glances of admiration\r\nupon the person of her lover, and sometimes she thought these glances\r\nwere perceived, and even returned. Now and then she had seen them\r\ntalking together; it was but for a moment or two, but much can be said\r\nin a brief space; it may have been on most unimportant topics, but how\r\ncould she know that? The girl was lovely, but she had dared to raise\r\nher eyes to the loved one of the princess; and, with all the intensity\r\nof the savage blood transmitted to her through long lines of wholly\r\nbarbaric ancestors, she hated the woman who blushed and trembled behind\r\nthat silent door.\r\n\r\nWhen her lover turned and looked at her, and his eye met hers as she\r\nsat there, paler and whiter than any one in the vast ocean of anxious\r\nfaces about her, he saw, by that power of quick perception which is\r\ngiven to those whose souls are one, that she knew behind which door\r\ncrouched the tiger, and behind which stood the lady. He had expected\r\nher to know it. He understood her nature, and his soul was assured that\r\nshe would never rest until she had made plain to herself this thing,\r\nhidden to all other lookers-on, even to the king. The only hope for the\r\nyouth in which there was any element of certainty was based upon the\r\nsuccess of the princess in discovering this mystery; and the moment he\r\nlooked upon her, he saw she had succeeded, as in his soul he knew she\r\nwould succeed.\r\n\r\nThen it was that his quick and anxious glance asked the question:\r\n\"Which?\" It was as plain to her as if he shouted it from where he\r\nstood. There was not an instant to be lost. The question was asked in a\r\nflash; it must be answered in another.\r\n\r\nHer right arm lay on the cushioned parapet before her. She raised her\r\nhand, and made a slight, quick movement toward the right. No one but\r\nher lover saw her. Every eye but his was fixed on the man in the arena.\r\n\r\nHe turned, and with a firm and rapid step he walked across the empty\r\nspace. Every heart stopped beating, every breath was held, every eye\r\nwas fixed immovably upon that man. Without the slightest hesitation, he\r\nwent to the door on the right, and opened it.\r\n\r\nNow, the point of the story is this: Did the tiger come out of that\r\ndoor, or did the lady?\r\n\r\nThe more we reflect upon this question, the harder it is to answer. It\r\ninvolves a study of the human heart which leads us through devious\r\nmazes of passion, out of which it is difficult to find our way. Think\r\nof it, fair reader, not as if the decision of the question depended\r\nupon yourself, but upon that hot-blooded, semi-barbaric princess, her\r\nsoul at a white heat beneath the combined fires of despair and\r\njealousy. She had lost him, but who should have him?\r\n\r\nHow often, in her waking hours and in her dreams, had she started in\r\nwild horror, and covered her face with her hands as she thought of her\r\nlover opening the door on the other side of which waited the cruel\r\nfangs of the tiger!\r\n\r\nBut how much oftener had she seen him at the other door! How in her\r\ngrievous reveries had she gnashed her teeth, and torn her hair, when\r\nshe saw his start of rapturous delight as he opened the door of the\r\nlady! How her soul had burned in agony when she had seen him rush to\r\nmeet that woman, with her flushing cheek and sparkling eye of triumph;\r\nwhen she had seen him lead her forth, his whole frame kindled with the\r\njoy of recovered life; when she had heard the glad shouts from the\r\nmultitude, and the wild ringing of the happy bells; when she had seen\r\nthe priest, with his joyous followers, advance to the couple, and make\r\nthem man and wife before her very eyes; and when she had seen them walk\r\naway together upon their path of flowers, followed by the tremendous\r\nshouts of the hilarious multitude, in which her one despairing shriek\r\nwas lost and drowned!\r\n\r\nWould it not be better for him to die at once, and go to wait for her\r\nin the blessed regions of semi-barbaric futurity?\r\n\r\nAnd yet, that awful tiger, those shrieks, that blood!\r\n\r\nHer decision had been indicated in an instant, but it had been made\r\nafter days and nights of anguished deliberation. She had known she\r\nwould be asked, she had decided what she would answer, and, without the\r\nslightest hesitation, she had moved her hand to the right.\r\n\r\nThe question of her decision is one not to be lightly considered, and\r\nit is not for me to presume to set myself up as the one person able to\r\nanswer it. And so I leave it with all of you: Which came out of the\r\nopened door,--the lady, or the tiger?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's The Lady, or the Tiger?, by Frank R. Stockton"

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\r\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements.

To\r\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\r\nparticular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\r\nTo donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\r\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\r\nwith anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project\r\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\r\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\r\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\r\n\r\n     www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks."

So ... a mechanical answerer,\r\n           geared to produce the ultimate revelations in reference to\r\n           anything you want to know, might have unsuspected\r\n           limitations._\r\n\r\n\r\n                       _Ask A Foolish Question_\r\n\r\n\r\n                         _by_ ROBERT SHECKLEY\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nAnswerer was built to last as long as was necessary--which was quite\r\nlong, as some races judge time, and not long at all, according to\r\nothers. But to Answerer, it was just long enough.\r\n\r\nAs to size, Answerer was large to some and small to others. He could\r\nbe viewed as complex, although some believed that he was really very\r\nsimple.\r\n\r\nAnswerer knew that he was as he should be. Above and beyond all else,\r\nhe was The Answerer. He Knew.\r\n\r\nOf the race that built him, the less said the better. They also Knew,\r\nand never said whether they found the knowledge pleasant.\r\n\r\nThey built Answerer as a service to less-sophisticated races, and\r\ndeparted in a unique manner. Where they went only Answerer knows.\r\n\r\nBecause Answerer knows everything.\r\n\r\nUpon his planet, circling his sun, Answerer sat. Duration continued,\r\nlong, as some judge duration, short as others judge it. But as it\r\nshould be, to Answerer.\r\n\r\nWithin him were the Answers. He knew the nature of things, and why\r\nthings are as they are, and what they are, and what it all means.\r\n\r\nAnswerer could answer anything, provided it was a legitimate question.\r\nAnd he wanted to! He was eager to!\r\n\r\nHow else should an Answerer be?\r\n\r\nWhat else should an Answerer do?\r\n\r\nSo he waited for creatures to come and ask.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"How do you feel, sir?\" Morran asked, floating gently over to the old\r\nman.\r\n\r\n\"Better,\" Lingman said, trying to smile. No-weight was a vast relief.\r\nEven though Morran had expended an enormous amount of fuel, getting\r\ninto space under minimum acceleration, Lingman's feeble heart hadn't\r\nliked it. Lingman's heart had balked and sulked, pounded angrily\r\nagainst the brittle rib-case, hesitated and sped up. It seemed for a\r\ntime as though Lingman's heart was going to stop, out of sheer pique.\r\n\r\nBut no-weight was a vast relief, and the feeble heart was going again.\r\n\r\nMorran had no such problems. His strong body was built for strain and\r\nstress. He wouldn't experience them on this trip, not if he expected\r\nold Lingman to live.\r\n\r\n\"I'm going to live,\" Lingman muttered, in answer to the unspoken\r\nquestion. \"Long enough to find out.\" Morran touched the controls, and\r\nthe ship slipped into sub-space like an eel into oil.\r\n\r\n\"We'll find out,\" Morran murmured. He helped the old man unstrap\r\nhimself. \"We're going to find the Answerer!\"\r\n\r\nLingman nodded at his young partner. They had been reassuring\r\nthemselves for years. Originally it had been Lingman's project. Then\r\nMorran, graduating from Cal Tech, had joined him. Together they had\r\ntraced the rumors across the solar system. The legends of an ancient\r\nhumanoid race who had known the answer to all things, and who had\r\nbuilt Answerer and departed.\r\n\r\n\"Think of it,\" Morran said. \"The answer to everything!\" A physicist,\r\nMorran had many questions to ask Answerer. The expanding universe; the\r\nbinding force of atomic nuclei; novae and supernovae; planetary\r\nformation; red shift, relativity and a thousand others.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" Lingman said. He pulled himself to the vision plate and looked\r\nout on the bleak prairie of the illusory sub-space. He was a biologist\r\nand an old man. He had two questions.\r\n\r\nWhat is life?\r\n\r\nWhat is death?\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAfter a particularly-long period of hunting purple, Lek and his\r\nfriends gathered to talk. Purple always ran thin in the neighborhood\r\nof multiple-cluster stars--why, no one knew--so talk was definitely in\r\norder.\r\n\r\n\"Do you know,\" Lek said, \"I think I'll hunt up this Answerer.\" Lek\r\nspoke the Ollgrat language now, the language of imminent decision.\r\n\r\n\"Why?\" Ilm asked him, in the Hvest tongue of light banter. \"Why do you\r\nwant to know things? Isn't the job of gathering purple enough for\r\nyou?\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" Lek said, still speaking the language of imminent decision. \"It\r\nis not.\" The great job of Lek and his kind was the gathering of\r\npurple. They found purple imbedded in many parts of the fabric of\r\nspace, minute quantities of it. Slowly, they were building a huge\r\nmound of it. What the mound was for, no one knew.\r\n\r\n\"I suppose you'll ask him what purple is?\" Ilm asked, pushing a star\r\nout of his way and lying down.\r\n\r\n\"I will,\" Lek said. \"We have continued in ignorance too long. We must\r\nknow the true nature of purple, and its meaning in the scheme of\r\nthings. We must know why it governs our lives.\" For this speech Lek\r\nswitched to Ilgret, the language of incipient-knowledge.\r\n\r\nIlm and the others didn't try to argue, even in the tongue of\r\narguments. They knew that the knowledge was important. Ever since the\r\ndawn of time, Lek, Ilm and the others had gathered purple. Now it was\r\ntime to know the ultimate answers to the universe--what purple was,\r\nand what the mound was for.\r\n\r\nAnd of course, there was the Answerer to tell them. Everyone had heard\r\nof the Answerer, built by a race not unlike themselves, now long\r\ndeparted.\r\n\r\n\"Will you ask him anything else?\" Ilm asked Lek.\r\n\r\n\"I don't know,\" Lek said. \"Perhaps I'll ask about the stars. There's\r\nreally nothing else important.\" Since Lek and his brothers had lived\r\nsince the dawn of time, they didn't consider death. And since their\r\nnumbers were always the same, they didn't consider the question of\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nBut purple? And the mound?\r\n\r\n\"I go!\" Lek shouted, in the vernacular of decision-to-fact.\r\n\r\n\"Good fortune!\" his brothers shouted back, in the jargon of\r\ngreatest-friendship.\r\n\r\nLek strode off, leaping from star to star.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAlone on his little planet, Answerer sat, waiting for the Questioners.\r\nOccasionally he mumbled the answers to himself. This was his\r\nprivilege. He Knew.\r\n\r\nBut he waited, and the time was neither too long nor too short, for\r\nany of the creatures of space to come and ask.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThere were eighteen of them, gathered in one place.\r\n\r\n\"I invoke the rule of eighteen,\" cried one. And another appeared, who\r\nhad never before been, born by the rule of eighteen.\r\n\r\n\"We must go to the Answerer,\" one cried. \"Our lives are governed by\r\nthe rule of eighteen. Where there are eighteen, there will be\r\nnineteen. Why is this so?\"\r\n\r\nNo one could answer.\r\n\r\n\"Where am I?\" asked the newborn nineteenth. One took him aside for\r\ninstruction.\r\n\r\nThat left seventeen. A stable number.\r\n\r\n\"And we must find out,\" cried another, \"Why all places are different,\r\nalthough there is no distance.\"\r\n\r\nThat was the problem. One is here. Then one is there. Just like that,\r\nno movement, no reason. And yet, without moving, one is in another\r\nplace.\r\n\r\n\"The stars are cold,\" one cried.\r\n\r\n\"Why?\"\r\n\r\n\"We must go to the Answerer.\"\r\n\r\nFor they had heard the legends, knew the tales. \"Once there was a\r\nrace, a good deal like us, and they Knew--and they told Answerer. Then\r\nthey departed to where there is no place, but much distance.\"\r\n\r\n\"How do we get there?\" the newborn nineteenth cried, filled now with\r\nknowledge.\r\n\r\n\"We go.\" And eighteen of them vanished. One was left. Moodily he\r\nstared at the tremendous spread of an icy star, then he too vanished.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"Those old legends are true,\" Morran gasped. \"There it is.\"\r\n\r\nThey had come out of sub-space at the place the legends told of, and\r\nbefore them was a star unlike any other star. Morran invented a\r\nclassification for it, but it didn't matter. There was no other like\r\nit.\r\n\r\nSwinging around the star was a planet, and this too was unlike any\r\nother planet. Morran invented reasons, but they didn't matter. This\r\nplanet was the only one.\r\n\r\n\"Strap yourself in, sir,\" Morran said. \"I'll land as gently as I can.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nLek came to Answerer, striding swiftly from star to star. He lifted\r\nAnswerer in his hand and looked at him.\r\n\r\n\"So you are Answerer,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" Answerer said.\r\n\r\n\"Then tell me,\" Lek said, settling himself comfortably in a gap\r\nbetween the stars, \"Tell me what I am.\"\r\n\r\n\"A partiality,\" Answerer said. \"An indication.\"\r\n\r\n\"Come now,\" Lek muttered, his pride hurt. \"You can do better than\r\nthat. Now then. The purpose of my kind is to gather purple, and to\r\nbuild a mound of it. Can you tell me the real meaning of this?\"\r\n\r\n\"Your question is without meaning,\" Answerer said. He knew what purple\r\nactually was, and what the mound was for. But the explanation was\r\nconcealed in a greater explanation. Without this, Lek's question was\r\ninexplicable, and Lek had failed to ask the real question.\r\n\r\nLek asked other questions, and Answerer was unable to answer them. Lek\r\nviewed things through his specialized eyes, extracted a part of the\r\ntruth and refused to see more. How to tell a blind man the sensation\r\nof green?\r\n\r\nAnswerer didn't try. He wasn't supposed to.\r\n\r\nFinally, Lek emitted a scornful laugh. One of his little\r\nstepping-stones flared at the sound, then faded back to its usual\r\nintensity.\r\n\r\nLek departed, striding swiftly across the stars.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAnswerer knew. But he had to be asked the proper questions first. He\r\npondered this limitation, gazing at the stars which were neither large\r\nnor small, but exactly the right size.\r\n\r\nThe proper questions. The race which built Answerer should have taken\r\nthat into account, Answerer thought. They should have made some\r\nallowance for semantic nonsense, allowed him to attempt an\r\nunravelling.\r\n\r\nAnswerer contented himself with muttering the answers to himself.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nEighteen creatures came to Answerer, neither walking nor flying, but\r\nsimply appearing. Shivering in the cold glare of the stars, they gazed\r\nup at the massiveness of Answerer.\r\n\r\n\"If there is no distance,\" one asked, \"Then how can things be in other\r\nplaces?\"\r\n\r\nAnswerer knew what distance was, and what places were. But he couldn't\r\nanswer the question. There was distance, but not as these creatures\r\nsaw it. And there were places, but in a different fashion from that\r\nwhich the creatures expected.\r\n\r\n\"Rephrase the question,\" Answerer said hopefully.\r\n\r\n\"Why are we short here,\" one asked, \"And long over there? Why are we\r\nfat over there, and short here? Why are the stars cold?\"\r\n\r\nAnswerer knew all things. He knew why stars were cold, but he couldn't\r\nexplain it in terms of stars or coldness.\r\n\r\n\"Why,\" another asked, \"Is there a rule of eighteen? Why, when eighteen\r\ngather, is another produced?\"\r\n\r\nBut of course the answer was part of another, greater question, which\r\nhadn't been asked.\r\n\r\nAnother was produced by the rule of eighteen, and the nineteen\r\ncreatures vanished.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAnswerer mumbled the right questions to himself, and answered them.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"We made it,\" Morran said. \"Well, well.\" He patted Lingman on the\r\nshoulder--lightly, because Lingman might fall apart.\r\n\r\nThe old biologist was tired. His face was sunken, yellow, lined.\r\nAlready the mark of the skull was showing in his prominent yellow\r\nteeth, his small, flat nose, his exposed cheekbones. The matrix was\r\nshowing through.\r\n\r\n\"Let's get on,\" Lingman said. He didn't want to waste any time. He\r\ndidn't have any time to waste.\r\n\r\nHelmeted, they walked along the little path.\r\n\r\n\"Not so fast,\" Lingman murmured.\r\n\r\n\"Right,\" Morran said. They walked together, along the dark path of the\r\nplanet that was different from all other planets, soaring alone around\r\na sun different from all other suns.\r\n\r\n\"Up here,\" Morran said. The legends were explicit. A path, leading to\r\nstone steps. Stone steps to a courtyard. And then--the Answerer!\r\n\r\nTo them, Answerer looked like a white screen set in a wall. To their\r\neyes, Answerer was very simple.\r\n\r\nLingman clasped his shaking hands together. This was the culmination\r\nof a lifetime's work, financing, arguing, ferreting bits of legend,\r\nending here, now.\r\n\r\n\"Remember,\" he said to Morran, \"We will be shocked. The truth will be\r\nlike nothing we have imagined.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm ready,\" Morran said, his eyes rapturous.\r\n\r\n\"Very well. Answerer,\" Lingman said, in his thin little voice, \"What\r\nis life?\"\r\n\r\nA voice spoke in their heads. \"The question has no meaning. By 'life,'\r\nthe Questioner is referring to a partial phenomenon, inexplicable\r\nexcept in terms of its whole.\"\r\n\r\n\"Of what is life a part?\" Lingman asked.\r\n\r\n\"This question, in its present form, admits of no answer. Questioner\r\nis still considering 'life,' from his personal, limited bias.\"\r\n\r\n\"Answer it in your own terms, then,\" Morran said.\r\n\r\n\"The Answerer can only answer questions.\" Answerer thought again of\r\nthe sad limitation imposed by his builders.\r\n\r\nSilence.\r\n\r\n\"Is the universe expanding?\" Morran asked confidently.\r\n\r\n\"'Expansion' is a term inapplicable to the situation. Universe, as the\r\nQuestioner views it, is an illusory concept.\"\r\n\r\n\"Can you tell us _anything_?\" Morran asked.\r\n\r\n\"I can answer any valid question concerning the nature of things.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe two men looked at each other.\r\n\r\n\"I think I know what he means,\" Lingman said sadly. \"Our basic\r\nassumptions are wrong. All of them.\"\r\n\r\n\"They can't be,\" Morran said. \"Physics, biology--\"\r\n\r\n\"Partial truths,\" Lingman said, with a great weariness in his voice.\r\n\"At least we've determined that much. We've found out that our\r\ninferences concerning observed phenomena are wrong.\"\r\n\r\n\"But the rule of the simplest hypothesis--\"\r\n\r\n\"It's only a theory,\" Lingman said.\r\n\r\n\"But life--he certainly could answer what life is?\"\r\n\r\n\"Look at it this way,\" Lingman said. \"Suppose you were to ask, 'Why\r\nwas I born under the constellation Scorpio, in conjunction with\r\nSaturn?' I would be unable to answer your question _in terms of the\r\nzodiac_, because the zodiac has nothing to do with it.\"\r\n\r\n\"I see,\" Morran said slowly. \"He can't answer questions in terms of\r\nour assumptions.\"\r\n\r\n\"That seems to be the case. And he can't alter our assumptions. He is\r\nlimited to valid questions--which imply, it would seem, a knowledge we\r\njust don't have.\"\r\n\r\n\"We can't even ask a valid question?\" Morran asked. \"I don't believe\r\nthat. We must know some basics.\" He turned to Answerer. \"What is\r\ndeath?\"\r\n\r\n\"I cannot explain an anthropomorphism.\"\r\n\r\n\"Death an anthropomorphism!\" Morran said, and Lingman turned quickly.\r\n\"Now we're getting somewhere!\"\r\n\r\n\"Are anthropomorphisms unreal?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"Anthropomorphisms may be classified, tentatively, as, A, false\r\ntruths, or B, partial truths in terms of a partial situation.\"\r\n\r\n\"Which is applicable here?\"\r\n\r\n\"Both.\"\r\n\r\nThat was the closest they got. Morran was unable to draw any more from\r\nAnswerer. For hours the two men tried, but truth was slipping farther\r\nand farther away.\r\n\r\n\"It's maddening,\" Morran said, after a while. \"This thing has the\r\nanswer to the whole universe, and he can't tell us unless we ask the\r\nright question. But how are we supposed to know the right question?\"\r\n\r\nLingman sat down on the ground, leaning against a stone wall. He\r\nclosed his eyes.\r\n\r\n\"Savages, that's what we are,\" Morran said, pacing up and down in\r\nfront of Answerer. \"Imagine a bushman walking up to a physicist and\r\nasking him why he can't shoot his arrow into the sun. The scientist\r\ncan explain it only in his own terms. What would happen?\"\r\n\r\n\"The scientist wouldn't even attempt it,\" Lingman said, in a dim\r\nvoice; \"he would know the limitations of the questioner.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's fine,\" Morran said angrily. \"How do you explain the earth's\r\nrotation to a bushman? Or better, how do you explain relativity to\r\nhim--maintaining scientific rigor in your explanation at all times, of\r\ncourse.\"\r\n\r\nLingman, eyes closed, didn't answer.\r\n\r\n\"We're bushmen. But the gap is much greater here. Worm and super-man,\r\nperhaps. The worm desires to know the nature of dirt, and why there's\r\nso much of it. Oh, well.\"\r\n\r\n\"Shall we go, sir?\" Morran asked. Lingman's eyes remained closed. His\r\ntaloned fingers were clenched, his cheeks sunk further in. The skull\r\nwas emerging.\r\n\r\n\"Sir! Sir!\"\r\n\r\nAnd Answerer knew that that was not the answer.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAlone on his planet, which is neither large nor small, but exactly the\r\nright size, Answerer waits. He cannot help the people who come to him,\r\nfor even Answerer has restrictions.\r\n\r\nHe can answer only valid questions.\r\n\r\nUniverse? Life? Death? Purple? Eighteen?\r\n\r\nPartial truths, half-truths, little bits of the great question.\r\n\r\nBut Answerer, alone, mumbles the questions to himself, the true\r\nquestions, which no one can understand.\r\n\r\nHow could they understand the true answers?\r\n\r\nThe questions will never be asked, and Answerer remembers something\r\nhis builders knew and forgot.\r\n\r\nIn order to ask a question you must already know most of the answer.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's Ask a Foolish Question, by Robert Sheckley"

    "content": "Justice\r\n\r\n                            by J. F. Hutton\r\n\r\n\r\n  Urs’ sword was not designed for a Briton’s pleasure. But to a kingly\r\n  man Time has no boundary.\r\n\r\n  _There are historical figures so resplendent in their legendary\r\n  permanence that no one age can truly claim them. Their deeds ring out\r\n  across history, for youth must eternally respond to a clarion call\r\n  which Time’s tyranny will never silence. Give ear, then, as J. F.\r\n  Hutton evokes from the past a marvel as mysterious as the time travel\r\n  paradox at the core of this amazing story_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAs Urs stood facing the System Policy Board, his young face mirrored an\r\nincredible confidence which gave no hint of the tormenting uncertainty\r\nwithin him. Few of the billions watching on life-view screens suspected\r\nthe effort it cost him to remain outwardly poised and self-reliant.\r\n\r\nFor this was no departmental board, judging small matters of\r\ndiscipline. This was the big one. Much more than the welfare of one\r\nindividual was involved in any matter that came before it. It was the\r\nultimate court. And it was motivated by one principle--absolute justice.\r\n\r\nBefore he had been summoned, Urs had spent a half hour with the\r\ndirector of the Time Traveler’s Bureau. They hadn’t talked much, after\r\nthe director’s opening words of reassurance.\r\n\r\n“Urs, all of us know we’re doing the best we can under difficult\r\nconditions. We’ve managed to keep our problems to ourselves, so far.\r\nNow that’s over. We’re not blaming you. It could have happened to any\r\nof us. We’ll just have to consider it a bad break, and hope for the\r\nbest.”\r\n\r\nNow the director and dozens of Urs’ colleagues were watching, in silent\r\nanxiety. They were sweating it out with him, reminding themselves that\r\nany one of them could just as well be on trial instead.\r\n\r\nThe white-haired chairman of the Policy Board stirred in his recliner.\r\n“Third Level Time Explorer Urs, you are charged with breaking System\r\nPolicy Rule number 86, Subhead C, of the General Code of Time Travel:\r\n‘No visitor to a previous time shall in any way allow the knowledge or\r\ntechniques of the future to become a part of that preceding culture.’\r\n\r\n“You learned this rule in the first week of your preliminary training.\r\nIt has been periodically reviewed in your refresher courses since. And\r\nyou received special indoctrination before each of your trips.”\r\n\r\nStanding tall and straight in his sky-blue uniform, Urs could only nod.\r\n\r\nThe five other members of the Board steadily regarded the young man\r\nbefore them. Their gazes held neither censure nor sympathy. They were\r\nof the same stamp as the chairman--pale, professional weighers of\r\nevidence.\r\n\r\nThe chairman continued, “Specifically, you entered a primitive\r\nsociety on the planet Earth in a region known as Great Britain. Your\r\nproject was to gather data for a culture-graph, in conformity with\r\nthe continuing study of a pattern which originated in that area and\r\nsubsequently profoundly affected Earth and her satellites.\r\n\r\n“An experienced Time Traveler, you had the customary\r\nindoctrination--costume, mores, language, comprehension levels, and so\r\non. Your equipment was made in accordance with careful specifications\r\nin the duplicating shops.”\r\n\r\nUrs spoke for the first time. To his surprise, his voice came out\r\nstrong and clear. “May I request, sir, that the record show that one\r\nitem of equipment was wrongly made? The wand. Instead of the crude\r\nmetal of the time I visited, it was made of our alloy, impregnium.”\r\n\r\n“That fact has been noted,” the chairman said gravely. He glanced\r\naround at his colleagues. “There was an acknowledged error in the\r\nshops. The situation has been corrected.”\r\n\r\n“Thank you.”\r\n\r\nYou never argued with the System Policy Board. You thought very\r\ncarefully before you even asked a question. Mostly, you just listened\r\nrespectfully, even when they were methodically destroying you. For\r\nthe Board was incorruptible. It was as nearly infallible as a human\r\ninstitution could be. It represented something man had sought for\r\nages--completely impartial justice.\r\n\r\nThere was a kind of inevitability in such trials which--tedious though\r\nsome of them were--never failed to attract enthralled watchers all over\r\nthe galaxy. And none had ever watched more tensely than the silent\r\nmen in blue uniforms before the big life screen at the Time Traveler’s\r\nBureau.\r\n\r\nThe chairman’s old eyes lingered on Urs. “You are held responsible here\r\nonly for your actions in the region called Great Britain. The error you\r\nmentioned, however, is pertinent to this inquiry. We have carefully\r\nexamined your personal experience tapes. They reveal you were aware of\r\nthe mistake in the metal in time to take corrective action before the\r\nrule was broken. This you failed to do.”\r\n\r\nIn spite of his effort at self-control, Urs trembled. He suddenly\r\nwanted to drown out those slow, logical phrases, to shout, “When did\r\nany of you ever travel in time? You sit here in the splendor of your\r\nlogic--mental and physical light-years away from the event. You can’t\r\nconceive how crude and disorganized those days were. Do you think\r\nit’s easy to enter a world like that? It takes all the skill and care\r\nand self-discipline you can command. And no man who ever lived could\r\nexercise the control the manuals call for.\r\n\r\n“If you only knew what really goes on in time exploration! You\r\n_think_ you do. You read the manuals, you examine the rules of\r\npolicy, you see the personal experience tapes we turn in. But did you\r\nknow that most of the time we manage to doctor those tapes, to protect\r\nourselves?\r\n\r\n“Ah, if you only knew....”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWearing light armor, Urs had been riding on a lonely trail. In that\r\ntime, in that place, it was a risky business--even for an Explorer. And\r\nhis luck ran out. Brigands caught up with him, charging on their wiry,\r\ntangle-haired horses.\r\n\r\nUrs whacked his own mount and tried to outrun them. Screeching, they\r\nchased him over gullies and ravines, through dense scrub and under oaks\r\nthat threatened to sweep him out of the saddle. But gradually, they\r\ngained on him.\r\n\r\nFor you can study the riding of horses. You can practice faithfully on\r\ntire test models. But you’ll never learn how difficult it really is\r\ntill you have a living, snorting beast lunging unpredictably between\r\nyour legs.\r\n\r\nInevitably, Urs fell off his horse. With the shouts of the brigands\r\nloud in his ears, with arrows plunking into the sod around him, he\r\ndived down a steep, grassy slope. Then he jumped up and ran, twisting\r\nand dodging among trees and rocks. In one hand he carried the shining\r\nwand that in England in those days was called a “sword.”\r\n\r\nThree of the robbers had left their horses to chase him on foot. The\r\nother three circled around to head him off. Halfway down the hill, Urs\r\nlost his footing and slid again. Flailing his arms, he fell against a\r\ngreat boulder. His wand, carried forward by his weight, plunged into\r\nthe rock.\r\n\r\nAt the moment, Urs was too busy dodging the arrows and regaining his\r\nbalance to realize what that meant. The men pounced on him. One held\r\nhis arms, while another caught him around the neck from behind.\r\n\r\nThe third man gave a great startled cry. Eyes wide, bristly face\r\ntwitching, he pointed one skinny arm at the rock. His companions\r\nlooked, gasped, and let go of Urs. They stood transfixed, showing all\r\nthe signs of men half-scared to death.\r\n\r\nThe other three, hearing the first exultant shouts, had dismounted and\r\nwere hurrying up. They saw the rock, with the sword buried in it nearly\r\nto the hilt. They stopped dead, turned pale, and began to tremble.\r\n\r\nUrs was understandably mystified by this abrupt change of pace. Staring\r\nat the rock, he became aware of what had happened. Had it been made of\r\nthe proper crude Earth metal, his wand could never have penetrated it.\r\nFor the first time he realized that the shops had sent him off with an\r\nimpregnium sword.\r\n\r\nThe only way out of the situation was to jerk the weapon loose, then\r\npress the time-stud embedded under the skin of his waist. But one of\r\nhis attackers, half-hysterical, was drawing his bow. Those brawny arms\r\nlooked strong enough to send an arrow to the moon. The wand dropped out\r\nof Urs’ mind. His fingers flew to the stud that would snatch him out of\r\nthis world and safely back to his own.\r\n\r\nHe vanished, leaving six badly frightened Englishmen blinking at the\r\nrock and the sword so impossibly fixed in it.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe chairman paused, looked courteously at Urs. The charge had been\r\nspecified. Now was the time for Urs to speak, if he had anything to say.\r\n\r\nUrs swallowed the dryness in his throat. “Sir, the facts you describe\r\nare correct.”\r\n\r\nThere was a stir among the watching men at the Time Traveler’s Bureau.\r\nAt millions of other locations, people in front of life screens nodded\r\nto one another. What else could he have said?\r\n\r\nUrs looked at the calm, intelligent faces before him. Now, if ever, was\r\nthe time for his outburst. But he couldn’t bring himself to speak. He\r\nmoistened his lips and kept silent.\r\n\r\nThe chairman nodded. “The Board will call a witness.”\r\n\r\nA security man opened a side door of the chamber. A tall red-headed\r\nman in a sky-blue uniform stepped hesitantly forward. He walked slowly\r\nacross the floor and stood beside Urs.\r\n\r\n“This is Third Level Time Explorer Renar.”\r\n\r\nUrs nodded dumbly. He and Renar were fellow-workers. They had parted at\r\nthe Time Traveler’s Bureau not an hour before. And from the look on his\r\nface, Renar was as surprised to be here as Urs was to see him.\r\n\r\n“Time Explorer Renar,” the chairman said, “please tell us the kind of\r\nwork you are doing now.”\r\n\r\nNervously, but with more assurance as he warmed up, Renar explained\r\nthat he had been working on the culture pattern of Great Britain. The\r\nstudies that he, Urs and others were making would dove-tail into a\r\nmaster graph.\r\n\r\n“And what time were you studying, with relation to Urs’ last trip?”\r\n\r\nRenar scratched his head. “Roughly twenty years later.”\r\n\r\n“Thank you. Now will you tell us exactly what happened on your last\r\ntrip.”\r\n\r\nRenar hesitated, his homely face screwed up concernedly. “Well,” he\r\nbegan--and stopped.\r\n\r\nThere was the faintest lessening of the sternness in the chairman’s\r\nface. It could not have been called a smile, nor even the beginning\r\nof one. But it matched the shade of sympathetic understanding in his\r\nvoice. “Renar, may I remind you I already know what happened. I want\r\nUrs and the others to hear it.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, sir.” Renar still looked troubled. “You must understand that time\r\ntravel does not always work out according to the rules. Things happen--”\r\n\r\n“That,” the chairman said, “is the reason for this trial. Now please\r\ndescribe your arrival in primitive Great Britain.”\r\n\r\n“Well, sir, when I made my last trip, there was some slight error in\r\ncalculating the physical plane of my appearance. When I came out in\r\nthat previous time I was not on dry land, but under water.”\r\n\r\nNot one of the Board members smiled. But there were chuckles in front\r\nof millions of life screens.\r\n\r\n“I wasn’t far under the surface. But you can understand I was startled\r\nand confused. I thrashed around, trying to get to air. One arm broke\r\nthrough the surface of the lake I was in. To my great surprise,\r\nsomething was immediately dropped into it. Instinctively, I grabbed\r\nhold and pulled. But the object wasn’t attached to anything.\r\n\r\n“On the contrary, its extra weight added to mine caused me to start\r\nsinking. I struggled a few seconds longer. Then I gave up, pressed my\r\nwaist stud, and returned to the present.”\r\n\r\n“And the object?”\r\n\r\n“I held on to it. It’s in my room at the Time Traveler’s Bureau.\r\nI--uh--”\r\n\r\n\r\n“Yes,” the chairman said calmly, “you were troubled about reporting it.\r\nBecause it meant something had gone wrong. Somewhere along the line,\r\nthe rules had been violated.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, sir,” Renar said, a little despairingly.\r\n\r\nUrs spoke. “Honorable Chairman, may I say that every man connected with\r\nTime Travel is loyal and conscientious. We all try to adhere strictly\r\nto the code. It was not Renar’s fault that this unforeseen emergency\r\narose.”\r\n\r\n“Thank you, Urs.” The chairman raised a hand. A Security man approached\r\nand held something out. “Renar, is this what you caught hold of in the\r\nwater?”\r\n\r\nRenar nodded. Urs gasped. It was the shining impregnium wand he had\r\nleft in the rock!\r\n\r\nBack in the Time Traveler’s Bureau, the men looked at each other and\r\nstarted to talk excitedly.\r\n\r\nThe Board members leaned forward in their recliners for a closer\r\ninspection of the sword. Urs and Renar exchanged a quick, hopeful\r\nglance.\r\n\r\n“You, Urs, allowed this wand to become a part of that ancient culture.\r\nIt remained there for twenty years or so. The people of that time did\r\nnot know how it was made, nor did they discover any of our techniques\r\nfrom it. It has now been removed from that time.\r\n\r\n“We are now faced with a matter of interpretation of Policy Rule number\r\n86, Subhead C, which does not consider the subsequent removal of a\r\nknowledge or technique inadvertently left in the past. I shall call\r\nanother witness.”\r\n\r\nUrs and Renar turned. A short, precise man in a rust-colored uniform\r\ncame out of the side door and marched up beside them.\r\n\r\n“Morrey,” the chairman said, “will you please describe your work?”\r\n\r\n“Sir,” Morrey said in a businesslike voice, “I am an historical\r\nsynthesist. I take the reports of the Time Explorers and fit them\r\ntogether into culture graphs. I analyze and interpret the data that\r\ncomes in, and I make recommendations for further time explorations, as\r\nneeded.”\r\n\r\n“Thank you. Now will you please tell Explorers Urs and Renar about the\r\ndominant personality in Great Britain during the period between their\r\nrespective visits?”\r\n\r\n“Gladly, sir.” Morrey turned slightly toward the two. “We are not\r\nentirely certain, yet, how much is fact and how much legend, for the\r\nstory of this man reached far forward in history. But we do know\r\nthat he became famous because he was the only man who could pull the\r\nwand--which they called a ‘sword’--from the rock in which it was\r\nembedded. He kept it. Because of properties which we take for granted,\r\nthe sword had a strange and wonderful appeal to the imaginations of\r\nhis time. In their superstitious way, those people attributed magical\r\nqualities to it, and to the one who carried it.\r\n\r\n“That man became a king. He was one of the strongest forces for good,\r\nfor order, and for justice that civilization there had seen. The\r\nman was a giant, in mind and stature. He had a tremendous impact on\r\nhis time. As I said before, he became a legendary figure. His story\r\nretained the power to thrill people for centuries afterward.\r\n\r\n“We are not sure how much this man knew or suspected about the wand.\r\nWe are still studying that. But it is clear from the way he disposed\r\nof it when he lay dying, that he may have had some insight into its\r\nsource. He sent one of his men, who bore the quaint name of ‘Bedivere’\r\nto return it to a mythical ‘Lady of the Lake.’ Bedivere, of course, saw\r\nRenar’s hand rising from the water at precisely the correct moment, and\r\nplaced the sword in it.”\r\n\r\nThe chairman was silent a few moments after Morrey finished. “And what\r\ndid they call this man?”\r\n\r\n“King Arthur.”\r\n\r\nThe old man nodded. “Third Level Time Explorer Urs, have you anything\r\nfurther to say?”\r\n\r\nUrs gulped. “No, sir.”\r\n\r\n“Then the Board finds that you have violated the letter of the General\r\nCode of Time Travel.”\r\n\r\nIn the lounge of the Bureau, the waiting men blanched and looked at one\r\nanother in shock.\r\n\r\n“However,” the chairman of the System Policy Board went on, “the Board\r\nalso finds that you have not violated the spirit in which the Code was\r\ndrafted. Neither, in spite of his irregular experience, did Explorer\r\nRenar.\r\n\r\n“A just decision must take both of these factors into proper account.\r\nThanks to the accident that befell Renar, and to the character of this\r\nancient man, King Arthur, we pronounce you free to return to your work\r\nwith your record unblemished.”\r\n\r\nIn the Time Traveler’s Bureau, men shouted and pounded one another on\r\nthe back. People smiled, in front of their life screens all over the\r\ngalaxy. “Justice,” they said to one another.\r\n\r\nUrs bowed respectfully to the Board, then turned and clasped Renar’s\r\nhand.\r\n\r\nThey walked back to the Bureau together.\r\n\r\n“I owe you a drink,” Urs said.\r\n\r\n“I’ll take it gladly,” Renar replied. “You knew you were going to\r\nappear before the Board. They called me without warning. And that, my\r\nfriend, is a strain I hope you never go through.”\r\n\r\n“Well, the decision helps us all.” Urs extended the impregnium wand.\r\n“We’ll keep this in the hall, as a reminder. What was it Morrey said\r\nthey called it?”\r\n\r\nRenar scratched his red head. “It was a strange name. Oh, yes.\r\nExcalibur.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscriber’s Note:\r\n\r\n\r\n  This etext was produced from Fantastic Universe, March 1956 (Vol. 5,\r\nNo. 2.).

The argument had been long and heated, and at last\r\nMr. Morehouse had talked himself speechless. The cause of the trouble\r\nstood on the counter between the two men. It was a soap box across\r\nthe top of which were nailed a number of strips, forming a rough but\r\nserviceable cage. In it two spotted guinea-pigs were greedily eating\r\nlettuce leaves.\r\n\r\n“Do as you loike, then!” shouted Flannery, “pay for thim an' take\r\nthim, or don't pay for thim and leave thim be. Rules is rules, Misther\r\nMorehouse, an' Mike Flannery's not goin' to be called down fer breakin'\r\nof thim.”\r\n\r\n“But, you everlastingly stupid idiot!” shouted Mr. Morehouse, madly\r\nshaking a flimsy printed book beneath the agent's nose, “can't you read\r\nit here-in your own plain printed rates? 'Pets, domestic, Franklin to\r\nWestcote, if properly boxed, twenty-five cents each.'” He threw the book\r\non the counter in disgust. “What more do you want? Aren't they pets?\r\nAren't they domestic? Aren't they properly boxed? What?”\r\n\r\nHe turned and walked back and forth rapidly; frowning ferociously.\r\n\r\nSuddenly he turned to Flannery, and forcing his voice to an artificial\r\ncalmness spoke slowly but with intense sarcasm.\r\n\r\n“Pets,” he said “P-e-t-s! Twenty-five cents each. There are two of them.\r\nOne! Two! Two times twenty-five are fifty! Can you understand that? I\r\noffer you fifty cents.”\r\n\r\nFlannery reached for the book. He ran his hand through the pages and\r\nstopped at page sixty four.\r\n\r\n“An' I don't take fifty cints,” he whispered in mockery. “Here's the\r\nrule for ut. 'Whin the agint be in anny doubt regardin' which of two\r\nrates applies to a shipment, he shall charge the larger. The con-sign-ey\r\nmay file a claim for the overcharge.' In this case, Misther Morehouse,\r\nI be in doubt. Pets thim animals may be, an' domestic they be, but pigs\r\nI'm blame sure they do be, an' me rules says plain as the nose on\r\nyer face, 'Pigs Franklin to Westcote, thirty cints each.' An' Mister\r\nMorehouse, by me arithmetical knowledge two times thurty comes to sixty\r\ncints.”\r\n\r\nMr. Morehouse shook his head savagely. “Nonsense!” he shouted,\r\n“confounded nonsense, I tell you! Why, you poor ignorant foreigner, that\r\nrule means common pigs, domestic pigs, not guinea pigs!”\r\n\r\nFlannery was stubborn.\r\n\r\n“Pigs is pigs,” he declared firmly. “Guinea-pigs, or dago pigs or Irish\r\npigs is all the same to the Interurban Express Company an' to Mike\r\nFlannery. Th' nationality of the pig creates no differentiality in the\r\nrate, Misther Morehouse! 'Twould be the same was they Dutch pigs or\r\nRooshun pigs. Mike Flannery,” he added, “is here to tind to the expriss\r\nbusiness and not to hould conversation wid dago pigs in sivinteen\r\nlanguages fer to discover be they Chinese or Tipperary by birth an'\r\nnativity.”\r\n\r\nMr. Morehouse hesitated. He bit his lip and then flung out his arms\r\nwildly.\r\n\r\n“Very well!” he shouted, “you shall hear of this! Your president shall\r\nhear of this! It is an outrage! I have offered you fifty cents. You\r\nrefuse it! Keep the pigs until you are ready to take the fifty cents,\r\nbut, by George, sir, if one hair of those pigs' heads is harmed I will\r\nhave the law on you!”\r\n\r\nHe turned and stalked out, slamming the door. Flannery carefully lifted\r\nthe soap box from the counter and placed it in a corner. He was not\r\nworried. He felt the peace that comes to a faithful servant who has done\r\nhis duty and done it well.\r\n\r\nMr. Morehouse went home raging. His boy, who had been awaiting the\r\nguinea-pigs, knew better than to ask him for them. He was a normal boy\r\nand therefore always had a guilty conscience when his father was\r\nangry. So the boy slipped quietly around the house. There is nothing so\r\nsoothing to a guilty conscience as to be out of the path of the avenger.\r\nMr. Morehouse stormed into the house. “Where's the ink?” he shouted at\r\nhis wife as soon as his foot was across the doorsill.\r\n\r\nMrs. Morehouse jumped, guiltily. She never used ink. She had not seen\r\nthe ink, nor moved the ink, nor thought of the ink, but her husband's\r\ntone convicted her of the guilt of having borne and reared a boy, and\r\nshe knew that whenever her husband wanted anything in a loud voice the\r\nboy had been at it.\r\n\r\n“I'll find Sammy,” she said meekly.\r\n\r\nWhen the ink was found Mr. Morehouse wrote rapidly, and he read the\r\ncompleted letter and smiled a triumphant smile.\r\n\r\n“That will settle that crazy Irishman!” he exclaimed. “When they get\r\nthat letter he will hunt another job, all right!”\r\n\r\nA week later Mr. Morehouse received a long official envelope with the\r\ncard of the Interurban Express Company in the upper left corner. He tore\r\nit open eagerly and drew out a sheet of paper. At the top it bore the\r\nnumber A6754. The letter was short. “Subject--Rate on guinea-pigs,”\r\n it said, “Dr. Sir--We are in receipt of your letter regarding rate on\r\nguinea-pigs between Franklin and Westcote addressed to the president\r\nof this company. All claims for overcharge should be addressed to the\r\nClaims Department.”\r\n\r\nMr. Morehouse wrote to the Claims Department. He wrote six pages of\r\nchoice sarcasm, vituperation and argument, and sent them to the Claims\r\nDepartment.\r\n\r\nA few weeks later he received a reply from the Claims Department.\r\nAttached to it was his last letter.\r\n\r\n“Dr. Sir,” said the reply. “Your letter of the 16th inst., addressed to\r\nthis Department, subject rate on guinea-pigs from Franklin to Westcote,\r\nree'd. We have taken up the matter with our agent at Westcote, and his\r\nreply is attached herewith. He informs us that you refused to receive\r\nthe consignment or to pay the charges. You have therefore no claim\r\nagainst this company, and your letter regarding the proper rate on the\r\nconsignment should be addressed to our Tariff Department.”\r\n\r\nMr. Morehouse wrote to the Tariff Department. He stated his case\r\nclearly, and gave his arguments in full, quoting a page or two from the\r\nencyclopedia to prove that guinea-pigs were not common pigs.\r\n\r\nWith the care that characterizes corporations when they are\r\nsystematically conducted, Mr. Morehouse's letter was numbered, O.K'd,\r\nand started through the regular channels. Duplicate copies of the bill\r\nof lading, manifest, Flannery's receipt for the package and several\r\nother pertinent papers were pinned to the letter, and they were passed\r\nto the head of the Tariff Department.\r\n\r\nThe head of the Tariff Department put his feet on his desk and yawned.\r\nHe looked through the papers carelessly.\r\n\r\n“Miss Kane,” he said to his stenographer, “take this letter. 'Agent,\r\nWestcote, N. J. Please advise why consignment referred to in attached\r\npapers was refused domestic pet rates.”'\r\n\r\nMiss Kane made a series of curves and angles on her note book and waited\r\nwith pencil poised. The head of the department looked at the papers\r\nagain.\r\n\r\n“Huh! guinea-pigs!” he said. “Probably starved to death by this time!\r\nAdd this to that letter: 'Give condition of consignment at present.'”\r\n\r\nHe tossed the papers on to the stenographer's desk, took his feet from\r\nhis own desk and went out to lunch.\r\n\r\nWhen Mike Flannery received the letter he scratched his head.\r\n\r\n“Give prisint condition,” he repeated thoughtfully. “Now what do thim\r\nclerks be wantin' to know, I wonder! 'Prisint condition, 'is ut? Thim\r\npigs, praise St. Patrick, do be in good health, so far as I know, but I\r\nniver was no veternairy surgeon to dago pigs. Mebby thim clerks wants\r\nme to call in the pig docther an' have their pulses took. Wan thing I\r\ndo know, howiver, which is they've glorious appytites for pigs of their\r\nsoize. Ate? They'd ate the brass padlocks off of a barn door I If the\r\npaddy pig, by the same token, ate as hearty as these dago pigs do,\r\nthere'd be a famine in Ireland.”\r\n\r\nTo assure himself that his report would be up to date, Flannery went\r\nto the rear of the office and looked into the cage. The pigs had been\r\ntransferred to a larger box--a dry goods box.\r\n\r\n“Wan, -- two, -- t'ree, -- four, -- five, -- six, -- sivin, -- eight!”\r\n he counted. “Sivin spotted an' wan all black. All well an' hearty an'\r\nall eatin' loike ragin' hippypottymusses. He went back to his desk and\r\nwrote.\r\n\r\n“Mr. Morgan, Head of Tariff Department,” he wrote. “Why do I say dago\r\npigs is pigs because they is pigs and will be til you say they ain't\r\nwhich is what the rule book says stop your jollying me you know it as\r\nwell as I do. As to health they are all well and hoping you are the\r\nsame. P. S. There are eight now the family increased all good eaters. P.\r\nS. I paid out so far two dollars for cabbage which they like shall I put\r\nin bill for same what?”\r\n\r\nMorgan, head of the Tariff Department, when he received this letter,\r\nlaughed. He read it again and became serious.\r\n\r\n“By George!” he said, “Flannery is right, 'pigs is pigs.' I'll have to\r\nget authority on this thing. Meanwhile, Miss Kane, take this letter:\r\nAgent, Westcote, N. J. Regarding shipment guinea-pigs, File No. A6754.\r\nRule 83, General Instruction to Agents, clearly states that agents\r\nshall collect from consignee all costs of provender, etc., etc.,\r\nrequired for live stock while in transit or storage. You will proceed to\r\ncollect same from consignee.”\r\n\r\nFlannery received this letter next morning, and when he read it he\r\ngrinned.\r\n\r\n“Proceed to collect,” he said softly. “How thim clerks do loike to be\r\ntalkin'! Me proceed to collect two dollars and twinty-foive cints off\r\nMisther Morehouse! I wonder do thim clerks know Misther Morehouse?\r\nI'll git it! Oh, yes! 'Misther Morehouse, two an' a quarter, plaze.'\r\n'Cert'nly, me dear frind Flannery. Delighted!' Not!”\r\n\r\nFlannery drove the express wagon to Mr. Morehouse's door. Mr. Morehouse\r\nanswered the bell.\r\n\r\n“Ah, ha!” he cried as soon as he saw it was Flannery. “So you've come to\r\nyour senses at last, have you? I thought you would! Bring the box in.”\r\n\r\n“I hev no box,” said Flannery coldly. “I hev a bill agin Misther John\r\nC. Morehouse for two dollars and twinty-foive cints for kebbages aten by\r\nhis dago pigs. Wud you wish to pay ut?”\r\n\r\n“Pay--Cabbages--!” gasped Mr. Morehouse. “Do you mean to say that two\r\nlittle guinea-pigs--”\r\n\r\n“Eight!” said Flannery. “Papa an' mamma an' the six childer. Eight!”\r\n\r\nFor answer Mr. Morehouse slammed the door in Flannery's face. Flannery\r\nlooked at the door reproachfully.\r\n\r\n“I take ut the con-sign-y don't want to pay for thim kebbages,” he said.\r\n“If I know signs of refusal, the con-sign-y refuses to pay for wan dang\r\nkebbage leaf an' be hanged to me!”\r\n\r\nMr. Morgan, the head of the Tariff Department, consulted the president\r\nof the Interurban Express Company regarding guinea-pigs, as to whether\r\nthey were pigs or not pigs. The president was inclined to treat the\r\nmatter lightly.\r\n\r\n“What is the rate on pigs and on pets?” he asked.\r\n\r\n“Pigs thirty cents, pets twenty-five,” said Morgan.\r\n\r\n“Then of course guinea-pigs are pigs,” said the president.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” agreed Morgan, “I look at it that way, too. A thing that can come\r\nunder two rates is naturally due to be classed as the higher. But are\r\nguinea-pigs, pigs? Aren't they rabbits?”\r\n\r\n“Come to think of it,” said the president, “I believe they are more like\r\nrabbits. Sort of half-way station between pig and rabbit. I think the\r\nquestion is this--are guinea-pigs of the domestic pig family? I'll ask\r\nprofessor Gordon. He is authority on such things. Leave the papers with\r\nme.”\r\n\r\nThe president put the papers on his desk and wrote a letter to Professor\r\nGordon. Unfortunately the Professor was in South America collecting\r\nzoological specimens, and the letter was forwarded to him by his wife.\r\nAs the Professor was in the highest Andes, where no white man had ever\r\npenetrated, the letter was many months in reaching him. The president\r\nforgot the guinea-pigs, Morgan forgot them, Mr. Morehouse forgot them,\r\nbut Flannery did not. One-half of his time he gave to the duties of\r\nhis agency; the other half was devoted to the guinea-pigs. Long before\r\nProfessor Gordon received the president's letter Morgan received one\r\nfrom Flannery.\r\n\r\n“About them dago pigs,” it said, “what shall I do they are great in\r\nfamily life, no race suicide for them, there are thirty-two now shall\r\nI sell them do you take this express office for a menagerie, answer\r\nquick.”\r\n\r\nMorgan reached for a telegraph blank and wrote:\r\n\r\n“Agent, Westcote. Don't sell pigs.”\r\n\r\nHe then wrote Flannery a letter calling his attention to the fact that\r\nthe pigs were not the property of the company but were merely being held\r\nduring a settlement of a dispute regarding rates. He advised Flannery to\r\ntake the best possible care of them.\r\n\r\nFlannery, letter in hand, looked at the pigs and sighed. The dry-goods\r\nbox cage had become too small. He boarded up twenty feet of the rear\r\nof the express office to make a large and airy home for them, and went\r\nabout his business. He worked with feverish intensity when out on his\r\nrounds, for the pigs required attention and took most of his time. Some\r\nmonths later, in desperation, he seized a sheet of paper and wrote\r\n“160” across it and mailed it to Morgan. Morgan returned it asking for\r\nexplanation. Flannery replied:\r\n\r\n“There be now one hundred sixty of them dago pigs, for heavens sake let\r\nme sell off some, do you want me to go crazy, what.”\r\n\r\n“Sell no pigs,” Morgan wired.\r\n\r\nNot long after this the president of the express company received a\r\nletter from Professor Gordon. It was a long and scholarly letter, but\r\nthe point was that the guinea-pig was the Cava aparoea while the common\r\npig was the genius Sus of the family Suidae. He remarked that they were\r\nprolific and multiplied rapidly.\r\n\r\n“They are not pigs,” said the president, decidedly, to Morgan. “The\r\ntwenty-five cent rate applies.”\r\n\r\nMorgan made the proper notation on the papers that had accumulated in\r\nFile A6754, and turned them over to the Audit Department. The Audit\r\nDepartment took some time to look the matter up, and after the usual\r\ndelay wrote Flannery that as he had on hand one hundred and sixty\r\nguinea-pigs, the property of consignee, he should deliver them and\r\ncollect charges at the rate of twenty-five cents each.\r\n\r\nFlannery spent a day herding his charges through a narrow opening in\r\ntheir cage so that he might count them.\r\n\r\n“Audit Dept.” he wrote, when he had finished the count, “you are way off\r\nthere may be was one hundred and sixty dago pigs once, but wake up don't\r\nbe a back number. I've got even eight hundred, now shall I collect\r\nfor eight hundred or what, how about sixty-four dollars I paid out for\r\ncabbages.”\r\n\r\nIt required a great many letters back and forth before the Audit\r\nDepartment was able to understand why the error had been made of billing\r\none hundred and sixty instead of eight hundred, and still more time for\r\nit to get the meaning of the “cabbages.”\r\n\r\nFlannery was crowded into a few feet at the extreme front of the\r\noffice. The pigs had all the rest of the room and two boys were employed\r\nconstantly attending to them. The day after Flannery had counted the\r\nguinea-pigs there were eight more added to his drove, and by the time\r\nthe Audit Department gave him authority to collect for eight hundred\r\nFlannery had given up all attempts to attend to the receipt or the\r\ndelivery of goods. He was hastily building galleries around the express\r\noffice, tier above tier. He had four thousand and sixty-four guinea-pigs\r\nto care for! More were arriving daily.\r\n\r\nImmediately following its authorization the Audit Department sent\r\nanother letter, but Flannery was too busy to open it. They wrote another\r\nand then they telegraphed:\r\n\r\n“Error in guinea-pig bill. Collect for two guinea-pigs, fifty cents.\r\nDeliver all to consignee.”\r\n\r\nFlannery read the telegram and cheered up. He wrote out a bill as\r\nrapidly as his pencil could travel over paper and ran all the way to the\r\nMorehouse home. At the gate he stopped suddenly. The house stared at\r\nhim with vacant eyes. The windows were bare of curtains and he could see\r\ninto the empty rooms. A sign on the porch said, “To Let.” Mr. Morehouse\r\nhad moved! Flannery ran all the way back to the express office.\r\nSixty-nine guinea-pigs had been born during his absence. He ran out\r\nagain and made feverish inquiries in the village. Mr. Morehouse had not\r\nonly moved, but he had left Westcote. Flannery returned to the express\r\noffice and found that two hundred and six guinea-pigs had entered the\r\nworld since he left it. He wrote a telegram to the Audit Department.\r\n\r\n“Can't collect fifty cents for two dago pigs consignee has left town\r\naddress unknown what shall I do? Flannery.”\r\n\r\nThe telegram was handed to one of the clerks in the Audit Department,\r\nand as he read it he laughed.\r\n\r\n“Flannery must be crazy. He ought to know that the thing to do is to\r\nreturn the consignment here,” said the clerk. He telegraphed Flannery to\r\nsend the pigs to the main office of the company at Franklin.\r\n\r\nWhen Flannery received the telegram he set to work. The six boys he\r\nhad engaged to help him also set to work. They worked with the haste of\r\ndesperate men, making cages out of soap boxes, cracker boxes, and all\r\nkinds of boxes, and as fast as the cages were completed they filled them\r\nwith guinea-pigs and expressed them to Franklin. Day after day the cages\r\nof guineapigs flowed in a steady stream from Westcote to Franklin,\r\nand still Flannery and his six helpers ripped and nailed and\r\npacked--relentlessly and feverishly. At the end of the week they had\r\nshipped two hundred and eighty cases of guinea-pigs, and there were in\r\nthe express office seven hundred and four more pigs than when they began\r\npacking them.\r\n\r\n“Stop sending pigs. Warehouse full,” came a telegram to Flannery. He\r\nstopped packing only long enough to wire back, “Can't stop,” and kept\r\non sending them. On the next train up from Franklin came one of\r\nthe company's inspectors. He had instructions to stop the stream of\r\nguinea-pigs at all hazards. As his train drew up at Westcote station\r\nhe saw a cattle car standing on the express company's siding. When he\r\nreached the express office he saw the express wagon backed up to the\r\ndoor. Six boys were carrying bushel baskets full of guinea-pigs from the\r\noffice and dumping them into the wagon. Inside the room Flannery, with'\r\nhis coat and vest off, was shoveling guinea-pigs into bushel baskets\r\nwith a coal scoop. He was winding up the guinea-pig episode.\r\n\r\nHe looked up at the inspector with a snort of anger.\r\n\r\n“Wan wagonload more an, I'll be quit of thim, an' niver will ye catch\r\nFlannery wid no more foreign pigs on his hands. No, sur! They near was\r\nthe death o' me. Nixt toime I'll know that pigs of whaiver nationality\r\nis domistic pets--an' go at the lowest rate.”\r\n\r\nHe began shoveling again rapidly, speaking quickly between breaths.\r\n\r\n“Rules may be rules, but you can't fool Mike Flannery twice wid the same\r\nthrick--whin ut comes to live stock, dang the rules. So long as Flannery\r\nruns this expriss office--pigs is pets--an' cows is pets--an' horses\r\nis pets--an' lions an' tigers an' Rocky Mountain goats is pets--an' the\r\nrate on thim is twinty-foive cints.”\r\n\r\nHe paused long enough to let one of the boys put an empty basket in the\r\nplace of the one he had just filled. There were only a few guinea-pigs\r\nleft. As he noted their limited number his natural habit of looking on\r\nthe bright side returned.\r\n\r\n“Well, annyhow,” he said cheerfully, “'tis not so bad as ut might be.\r\nWhat if thim dago pigs had been elephants!”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of “Pigs is Pigs”, by Ellis Parker Butler"

It exists\r\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\r\npeople in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\r\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\r\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf.\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 3.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\r\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.

To\r\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\r\nparticular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\r\nTo donate, please visit:\r\nhttp://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\r\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\r\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\r\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\r\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\r\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\r\n\r\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks."

    "content": "The Festival\r\n\r\nBy H. P. Lovecraft\r\n\r\nAuthor of “Dagon,” “The Rats in the Walls,” etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n    “Efficiunt daemones, ut quae non sunt, sic tamen quasi\r\n    sint, conspicienda hominibus exhibeant.”--Lactantius.\r\n\r\n\r\nI was far from home, and the spell of the eastern sea was upon me. In\r\nthe twilight I heard it pounding on the rocks, and I knew it lay just\r\nover the hill where the twisting willows writhed against the clearing\r\nsky and the first stars of evening. And because my fathers had called\r\nme to the old town beyond, I pushed on through the shallow, new-fallen\r\nsnow along the road that soared lonely up to where Aldebaran twinkled\r\namong the trees; on toward the very ancient town I had never seen but\r\noften dreamed of.\r\n\r\nIt was the Yuletide, which men call Christmas, though they know in\r\ntheir hearts it is older than Bethlehem and Babylon, older than\r\nMemphis and mankind. It was the Yuletide, and I had come at last to\r\nthe ancient sea town where my people had dwelt and kept festival in\r\nthe elder time when festival was forbidden; where also they had\r\ncommanded their sons to keep festival once every century, that the\r\nmemory of primal secrets might not be forgotten. Mine were an old\r\npeople, old even when this land was settled three hundred years\r\nbefore. And they were strange, because they had come as dark, furtive\r\nfolk from opiate southern gardens of orchids, and spoken another\r\ntongue before they learnt the tongue of the blue-eyed fishers. And now\r\nthey were scattered, and shared only the rituals of mysteries that\r\nnone living could understand. I was the only one who came back that\r\nnight to the old fishing town as legend bade, for only the poor and\r\nthe lonely remember.\r\n\r\nThen beyond the hill’s crest I saw Kingsport outspread frostily in the\r\ngloaming; snowy Kingsport with its ancient vanes and steeples,\r\nridgepoles and chimneypots, wharves and small bridges, willow trees\r\nand graveyards; endless labyrinths of steep, narrow, crooked streets,\r\nand dizzy church-crowned central peak that time durst not touch;\r\nceaseless mazes of colonial houses piled and scattered at all angles\r\nand levels like a child’s disordered blocks; antiquity hovering on\r\ngray wings over winter-whitened gables and gambrel roofs. And against\r\nthe rotting wharves the sea pounded; the secretive, immemorial sea out\r\nof which the people had come in the elder time.\r\n\r\nBeside the road at its crest a still higher summit rose, bleak and\r\nwindswept, and I saw that it was a burying-ground where black\r\ngravestones stuck ghoulishly through the snow like the decayed\r\nfingernails of a gigantic corpse. The printless road was very lonely,\r\nand sometimes I thought I heard a distant horrible creaking as of a\r\ngibbet in the wind. They had hanged four kinsmen of mine for\r\nwitchcraft in 1692, but I did not know just where.\r\n\r\nAs the road wound down the seaward slope I listened for the merry\r\nsounds of a village at evening, but did not hear them. Then I thought\r\nof the season, and felt that these old Puritan folk might well have\r\nChristmas customs strange to me, and full of silent hearthside prayer.\r\nSo after that I did not listen for merriment or look for wayfarers,\r\nbut kept on down past the hushed, lighted farmhouses and shadowy stone\r\nwalls to where the signs of ancient shops and sea taverns creaked in\r\nthe salt breeze, and the grotesque knockers of pillared doorways\r\nglistened along deserted, unpaved lanes in the light of little,\r\ncurtained windows.\r\n\r\nI had seen maps of the town, and knew where to find the home of my\r\npeople. It was told that I should be known and welcomed, for village\r\nlegend lives long; so I hastened through Back Street to Circle Court,\r\nand across the fresh snow on the one full flagstone pavement in the\r\ntown, to where Green Lane leads off behind the Market House. I was\r\nglad I had chosen to walk. The white village had seemed very beautiful\r\nfrom the hill; and now I was eager to knock at the door of my people,\r\nthe seventh house on the left in Green Lane, with an ancient peaked\r\nroof and jutting second story, all built before 1650.\r\n\r\nThere were lights inside the house when I came upon it, and I saw from\r\nthe diamond window-panes that it must have been kept very close to its\r\nantique state. The upper part overhung the narrow, grass-grown street\r\nand nearly met the overhanging part of the house opposite, so that I\r\nwas almost in a tunnel, with the low stone doorstep wholly free from\r\nsnow. There was no sidewalk, but many houses had high doors reached by\r\ndouble flights of steps with iron railings. It was an odd scene, and\r\nbecause I was strange to New England I had never known its like\r\nbefore. Though it pleased me, I would have relished it better if there\r\nhad been footprints in the snow, and people in the streets, and a few\r\nwindows without drawn curtains.\r\n\r\n                *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhen I sounded the archaic iron knocker I was half afraid. Some fear\r\nhad been gathering in me, perhaps because of the strangeness of my\r\nheritage, and the bleakness of the evening, and the queerness of the\r\nsilence in that aged town of curious customs. And when my knock was\r\nanswered I was fully afraid, because I had not heard any footsteps\r\nbefore the door creaked open. But I was not afraid long, for the\r\ngowned, slippered old man in the doorway had a bland face that\r\nreassured me; and though he made signs that he was dumb, he wrote a\r\nquaint and ancient welcome with the stylus and wax tablet he carried.\r\n\r\nHe beckoned me into a low, candlelit room with massive exposed rafters\r\nand dark, stiff, sparse furniture of the seventeenth century. The past\r\nwas vivid there, for not an attribute was missing. There was a\r\ncavernous fireplace and a spinning-wheel at which a bent old woman in\r\nloose wrapper and deep poke-bonnet sat back toward me, silently\r\nspinning despite the festive season. An infinite dampness seemed upon\r\nthe place, and I marveled that no fire should be blazing. The\r\nhigh-backed settle faced the row of curtained windows at the left, and\r\nseemed to be occupied, though I was not sure. I did not like\r\neverything about what I saw, and felt again the fear I had had. This\r\nfear grew stronger from what had before lessened it, for the more I\r\nlooked at the old man’s bland face, the more its very blandness\r\nterrified me. The eyes never moved, and the skin was too like wax.\r\nFinally I was sure it was not a face at all, but a fiendishly cunning\r\nmask. But the flabby hands, curiously gloved, wrote genially on the\r\ntablet and told me I must wait a while before I could be led to the\r\nplace of festival.\r\n\r\nPointing to a chair, table, and pile of books, the old man now left,\r\nthe room; and when I sat down to read I saw that the books were hoary\r\nand moldy, and that they included old Morryster’s wild “Marvels of\r\nScience,” the terrible “Saducismus Triumphatus” of Joseph Glanvil,\r\npublished in 1681, the shocking “Daemonolatreia” of Remigius, printed\r\nin 1595 at Lyons, and worst of all, the unmentionable “Necronomicon”\r\nof the mad Arab Abdul Alhazred, in Olaus Wormius’ forbidden Latin\r\ntranslation: a book which I had never seen, but of which I had heard\r\nmonstrous things whispered. No one spoke to me, but I could hear the\r\ncreaking of signs in the wind outside, and the whir of the wheel as\r\nthe bonneted old woman continued her silent spinning, spinning.\r\n\r\nI thought the room and the books and the people very morbid and\r\ndisquieting, but because an old tradition of my father’s had summoned\r\nme to strange feastings, I resolved to expect queer things. So I tried\r\nto read, and soon became tremblingly absorbed by something I found in\r\nthat accursed “Necronomicon”; a thought and a legend too hideous for\r\nsanity or consciousness. But I disliked it when I fancied I heard the\r\nclosing of one of the windows that the settle faced, as if it had been\r\nstealthily opened. It had seemed to follow a whirring that was not of\r\nthe old woman’s spinning-wheel. This was not much, though, for the old\r\nwoman was spinning very hard, and the aged clock had been striking.\r\nAfter that I lost the feeling that there were persons on the settle,\r\nand was reading intently and shudderingly when the old man came back\r\nbooted and dressed in a loose antique costume, and sat down on that\r\nvery bench, so that I could not see him. It was certainly nervous\r\nwaiting, and the blasphemous book in my hands made it doubly so. When\r\n11 o’clock struck, however, the old man stood up, glided to a massive\r\ncarved chest in a corner, and got two hooded cloaks, one of which he\r\ndonned, and the other of which he draped round the old woman, who was\r\nceasing her monotonous spinning. Then they both started for the outer\r\ndoor; the woman lamely creeping, and the old man, after picking up the\r\nvery book I had been reading, beckoning me as he drew his hood over\r\nthat unmoving face or mask.\r\n\r\nWe went out into the moonless and tortuous network of that incredibly\r\nancient town; went out as the lights in the curtained windows\r\ndisappeared one by one, and the Dog Star leered at the throng of\r\ncowled, cloaked figures that poured silently from every doorway and\r\nformed monstrous processions up this street and that, past the\r\ncreaking signs and antediluvian gables, the thatched roofs and the\r\ndiamond-paned windows; threading precipitous lanes where decaying\r\nhouses overlapped and crumbled together, gliding across open courts\r\nand churchyards where the bobbing lanterns made eldritch drunken\r\nconstellations.\r\n\r\nAmid these hushed throngs I followed my voiceless guides; jostled by\r\nelbows that seemed preternaturally soft, and pressed by chests and\r\nstomachs that seemed abnormally pulpy; but seeing never a face and\r\nhearing never a word. Up, up, up, the eery columns slithered, and I\r\nsaw that all the travelers were converging as they flowed near a sort\r\nof focus of crazy alleys at the top of a high hill in the center of\r\nthe town, where perched a great white church. I had seen it from the\r\nroad’s crest when I looked at Kingsport in the new dusk, and it had\r\nmade me shiver because Aldebaran had seemed to balance itself a moment\r\non the ghostly spire.\r\n\r\nThere was an open space around the church; partly a churchyard with\r\nspectral shafts, and partly a half-paved square swept nearly bare of\r\nsnow by the wind, and lined with unwholesomely archaic houses having\r\npeaked roofs and overhanging gables. Death-fires danced over the\r\ntombs, revealing gruesome vistas, though queerly failing to cast any\r\nshadows. Past the churchyard, where there were no houses, I could see\r\nover the hill’s summit and watch the glimmer of stars on the harbor,\r\nthough the town was invisible in the dark. Only once in a while a\r\nlantern bobbed horribly through serpentine alleys on its way to\r\novertake the throng that was now slipping speechlessly into the\r\nchurch.\r\n\r\nI waited till the crowd had oozed into the black doorway, and till all\r\nthe stragglers had followed. The old man was pulling at my sleeve, but\r\nI was determined to be the last. Then finally I went, the sinister man\r\nand the old spinning woman before me. Crossing the threshold into that\r\nswarming temple of unknown darkness, I turned once to look at the\r\noutside world as the churchyard phosphorescence cast a sickly glow on\r\nthe hilltop pavement. And as I did so I shuddered. For though the wind\r\nhad not left much snow, a few patches did remain on the path near the\r\ndoor; and in that fleeting backward look it seemed to my troubled eye\r\nthat they bore no mark of passing feet, not even mine.\r\n\r\nThe church was scarce lighted by all the lanterns that had entered it,\r\nfor most of the throng had already vanished. They had streamed up the\r\naisle between the high white pews to the trapdoor of the vaults which\r\nyawned loathsomely open just before the pulpit, and were now squirming\r\nnoiselessly in. I followed dumbly down the footworn steps and into the\r\ndank, suffocating crypt. The tail of that sinuous line of\r\nnight-marchers seemed very horrible, and as I saw them wriggling into\r\na venerable tomb, they seemed more horrible still. Then I noticed that\r\nthe tomb’s floor had an aperture down which the throng was sliding,\r\nand in a moment we were all descending an ominous staircase of\r\nrough-hewn stone; a narrow spiral staircase damp and peculiarly\r\nodorous, that wound endlessly down into the bowels of the hill, past\r\nmonotonous walls of dripping stone blocks and crumbling mortar. It was\r\na silent, shocking descent, and I observed after a horrible interval\r\nthat the walls and steps were changing in nature, as if chiseled out\r\nof the solid rock. What mainly troubled me was that the myriad\r\nfootfalls made no sound and set up no echoes. After more eons of\r\ndescent I saw some side passages or burrows leading from unknown\r\nrecesses of blackness to this shaft of nighted mystery. Soon they\r\nbecame excessively numerous, like impious catacombs of nameless\r\nmenace; and their pungent odor of decay grew quite unbearable. I knew\r\nwe must have passed down through the mountain and beneath the earth of\r\nKingsport itself, and I shivered that a town should be so aged and\r\nmaggoty with subterraneous evil.\r\n\r\nThen I saw the lurid shimmering of pale light, and heard the insidious\r\nlapping of sunless waters. Again I shivered, for I did not like the\r\nthings that the night had brought, and wished bitterly that no\r\nforefather had summoned me to this primal rite. As the steps and the\r\npassage grew broader, I heard another sound, the thin, whining mockery\r\nof a feeble flute; and suddenly there spread out before me the\r\nboundless vista of an inner world--a vast fungous shore litten by a\r\nbelching column of sick greenish flame and washed by a wide oily river\r\nthat flowed from abysses frightful and unsuspected to join the\r\nblackest gulfs of immemorial ocean.\r\n\r\n                *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFainting and gasping, I looked at that unhallowed Erebus of titan\r\ntoadstools, leprous fire and slimy water, and saw the cloaked throngs\r\nforming a semicircle around the blazing pillar. It was the Yule-rite,\r\nolder than man and fated to survive him; the primal rite of the\r\nsolstice and of spring’s promise beyond the snows; the rite of fire\r\nand evergreen, light and music. And in that Stygian grotto I saw them\r\ndo the rite, and adore the sick pillar of flame, and throw into the\r\nwater handfuls gouged out of the viscous vegetation which glittered\r\ngreen in the chlorotic glare. I saw this, and I saw something\r\namorphously squatted far away from the light, piping noisomely on a\r\nflute; and as the thing piped I thought I heard noxious muffled\r\nflutterings in the fetid darkness where I could not see. But what\r\nfrightened me most was that flaming column; spouting volcanically from\r\ndepths profound and inconceivable, casting no shadows as healthy flame\r\nshould, and coating the nitrous stone above with a nasty, venomous\r\nverdigris. For in all that seething combustion no warmth lay, but only\r\nthe clamminess of death and corruption.\r\n\r\nThe man who had brought me now squirmed to a point directly beside the\r\nhideous flame, and made stiff ceremonial motions to the semicircle he\r\nfaced. At certain stages of the ritual they did groveling obeisance,\r\nespecially when he held above his head that abhorrent “Necronomicon”\r\nhe had taken with him; and I shared all the obeisances because I had\r\nbeen summoned to this festival by the writings of my forefathers. Then\r\nthe old man made a signal to the half-seen flute-player in the\r\ndarkness, which player thereupon changed its feeble drone to a scarce\r\nlouder drone in another key; precipitating as it did so a horror\r\nunthinkable and unexpected. At this horror I sank nearly to the\r\nlichened earth, transfixed with a dread not of this nor any world, but\r\nonly of the mad spaces between the stars.\r\n\r\nOut of the unimaginable blackness beyond the gangrenous glare of that\r\ncold flame, out of the tartarean leagues through which that oily river\r\nrolled uncanny, unheard, and unsuspected, there flopped rhythmically a\r\nhorde of tame, trained, hybrid winged things that no sound eye could\r\never wholly grasp, or sound brain ever wholly remember. They were not\r\naltogether crows, nor moles, nor buzzards, nor ants, nor vampire bats,\r\nnor decomposed human beings, but something I cannot and must not\r\nrecall. They flopped limply along, half with their webbed feet and\r\nhalf with their membranous wings; and as they reached the throng of\r\ncelebrants the cowled figures seized and mounted them, and rode off\r\none by one along the reaches of that unlighted river, into pits and\r\ngalleries of panic where poison springs feed frightful and\r\nundiscoverable cataracts.\r\n\r\nThe old spinning woman had gone with the throng, and the old man\r\nremained only because I had refused when he motioned me to seize an\r\nanimal and ride like the rest. I saw when I staggered to my feet that\r\nthe amorphous flute-player had rolled out of sight, but that two of\r\nthe beasts were patiently standing by. As I hung back, the old man\r\nproduced his stylus and tablet and wrote that he was the true deputy\r\nof my fathers who had founded the Yule worship in this ancient place;\r\nthat it had been decreed I should come back; and that the most secret\r\nmysteries were yet to be performed. He wrote this in a very ancient\r\nhand, and when I still hesitated he pulled from his loose robe a seal\r\nring and a watch, both with my family arms, to prove that he was what\r\nhe said. But it was a hideous proof, because I knew from old papers that\r\nthat watch had been buried with my great-great-great-great-grandfather\r\nin 1698.\r\n\r\nPresently the old man drew back his hood and pointed to the family\r\nresemblance in his face, but I only shuddered, because I was sure that\r\nthe face was merely a devilish waxen mask. The flopping animals were\r\nnow scratching restlessly at the lichens, and I saw that the old man\r\nwas nearly as restless himself. When one of the things began to waddle\r\nand edge away, he turned quickly to stop it; so that the suddenness of\r\nhis motion dislodged the waxen mask from what should have been his\r\nhead. And then, because that nightmare’s position barred me from the\r\nstone staircase down which we had come, I flung myself into the oily\r\nunderground river that bubbled somewhere to the caves of the sea;\r\nflung myself into that putrescent juice of earth’s inner horrors\r\nbefore the madness of my screams could bring down upon me all the\r\ncharnel legions these pest-gulfs might conceal.\r\n\r\n                *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAt the hospital they told me I had been found half-frozen in Kingsport\r\nHarbor at dawn, clinging to the drifting spar that accident sent to\r\nsave me. They told me I had taken the wrong fork of the hill road the\r\nnight before, and fallen over the cliffs at Orange Point--a thing they\r\ndeducted from prints found in the snow. There was nothing I could say,\r\nbecause everything was wrong. Everything was wrong, with the broad\r\nwindow showing a sea of roofs in which only about one in five was\r\nancient, and the sound of trolleys and motors in the streets below.\r\nThey insisted that this was Kingsport, and I could not deny it.\r\n\r\nWhen I went delirious at hearing that the hospital stood near the old\r\nchurchyard on Central Hill, they sent me to St. Mary’s Hospital in\r\nArkham, where I could have better care. I liked it there, for the\r\ndoctors were broadminded, and even lent me their influence in\r\nobtaining the carefully sheltered copy of Alhazred’s objectionable\r\n“Necronomicon” from the library of Miskatonic University. They said\r\nsomething about a “psychosis,” and agreed that I had better get my\r\nharassing obsessions off my mind.\r\n\r\nSo I read again that hideous chapter, and shuddered doubly because it\r\nwas indeed not new to me. I had seen it before, let footprints tell\r\nwhat they might; and where it was I had seen it were best forgotten.\r\nThere was no one--in waking hours--who could remind me of it; but my\r\ndreams are filled with terror, because of phrases I dare not quote. I\r\ndare quote only one paragraph, put into such English as I can make\r\nfrom the awkward Low Latin.\r\n\r\n“The nethermost caverns,” wrote the mad Arab, “are not for the\r\nfathoming of eyes that see; for their marvels are strange and\r\nterrific. Cursed the ground where dead thoughts live new and oddly\r\nbodied, and evil the mind that is held by no head. Wisely did Ibn\r\nSchacabac say that happy is the tomb where no wizard hath lain, and\r\nhappy the town at night whose wizards are all in ashes. For it is of\r\nold rumor that the soul of the devil-bought hastes not from his\r\ncharnel clay, but fats and instructs _the very worm that gnaws_; till\r\nout of corruption horrid life springs, and the dull scavengers of\r\nearth wax crafty to vex it and swell monstrous to plague it. Great\r\nholes secretly are digged where earth’s pores ought to suffice, and\r\nthings have learnt to walk that ought to crawl.”\r\n\r\n[Transcriber’s Note: This story appeared in the January 1925 issue of\r\nWeird Tales Magazine.]"

But business is business,\r\n\teven when lives are at stake, and that cargo of salmon\r\n\trepresented a small fortune. A story with the tang of salt\r\n\tspray, and quiet, unself-conscious heroism of strong men.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe _Star_ left the city float in Ketchikan at six o’clock in the\r\nevening, headed down Revillagigedo channel, bound for the Prince of\r\nWales Island, thirty-four miles across the straits.\r\n\r\nA bad-weather flag had been run up on the post office flag pole just\r\nbefore the eighty-horse-power, seventy-foot purse-seine boat had cast\r\noff her lines. There was, so the weather man said, a fifty-mile blow\r\non the outside and the boats were all hurrying for port.\r\n\r\nThe city marshal, standing on the dock and watching the crew of seven\r\ndiscuss the matter, had given us some practical if blunt advice. It\r\nwas no time for a consumptive-engined, barnacle-encrusted cannery\r\ntender, smelling to high heaven of fish odors, to be out in this kind\r\nof weather. Not even though the smell was strong enough to float a\r\nbattleship. These were his words.\r\n\r\nBut it was imperative that the _Star_ get across. In her hold were\r\nfifteen thousand Sockeyes, choicest of Alaskan red salmon, which had\r\nbeen lifted from the company traps two days ago. Those salmon had to\r\nbe in the cannery in another ten hours or they would sour, and with\r\nSockeyes at forty cents apiece, and not many to be had at any price,\r\nit was easy to see that there was a small fortune in the bottom of\r\nthe boat.\r\n\r\nNineteen hundred and twenty was a poor fish season and the _Star_ had\r\nranged up and down the coast hundreds of miles, buying up everything\r\noffered.\r\n\r\n“What do you think, fellows?” asked Bob, our skipper.\r\n\r\n“Let’s go. Them fish has got to get out of that hold quick.” Ed Fraser\r\nemphasized his statement by taking a huge crescent-shaped segment out\r\nof a plug of Climax medium.\r\n\r\n“Rather rough,” suggested Milt, the son of an Alaskan mining magnate who\r\nwas out for his fall school money.\r\n\r\n“Hell, I’d just as soon drown as be on the same boat with sour fish,”\r\nspoke up Al, the engineer.\r\n\r\nCharlie, a short and pudgy bald-headed German grinned doubtfully and\r\nsquinted toward a leaden sky. Charlie scarcely ever said anything. It\r\ntook too long to talk.\r\n\r\n“What do you say, Hal?”\r\n\r\nI ran my fingers through a luxurious three-month beard--fully an\r\ninch or an inch and a half long--and tried to look judicial. Most of\r\nall I wanted a good long sleep, after having been battered around\r\nthe wheelhouse through a week’s steady running in rough water. Then\r\nI wanted to have a night off in Ketchikan and limber up the rusty\r\nsprings of joviality; we hadn’t been near a town for a month. Added\r\nto these reasons was the gale outside.\r\n\r\n“Um,” I said, trying to convey an impartial answer.\r\n\r\n“How’s the engine running, Al?” Bob queried.\r\n\r\n“It’s all right, if the carburetor’ll only keep mixin’ like it has been\r\nth’ past few days.”\r\n\r\n“Got plenty of oil and gas?”\r\n\r\n“Yep. Both tanks full.”\r\n\r\n“All right; let’s go, gang. What say?”\r\n\r\n“Go she is.”\r\n\r\n“Ed, you better lash down everything above deck--Charlie, giv’m a\r\nhand-- Hal, take first trick at the wheel---- Ahoy, on the dock, let\r\ngo our lines will you?” and shortly, with a farewell screech, we were\r\nout in the channel.\r\n\r\nA short distance down we passed a subchaser on our port side, coming\r\nin. As I took a spoke in the wheel I wished very fervently that I was\r\non that boat, bound back to the dock. I clawed around with my free\r\nhand and drew up the tops of my boots, and reached over for my oil\r\ncoat which hung on a hook. This sounds strange, I know; but there is\r\na curious sensation of dampness that pervades one when running in a\r\nheavy sea, and be the pilot house ever so comfortable and warm, the\r\nsight of wave after wave piling up and smashing over the bow always\r\nmakes one mechanically reach for boots and slicker. I was beginning\r\nto see things, though we were still in calm water, comparatively.\r\n\r\nThe run down the protected channel was quickly made. We passed a score\r\nof cannery tenders, all bound for town. Most of the men on them waved at\r\nus wildly and pointed the other way. I gave them all a debonair toot of\r\nthe whistle, a bit of hypocrisy that soothed my feelings considerably.\r\n\r\nThe trap door connecting the pilot house with the galley opened and Bob\r\nentered, wiping his mouth on the back of his jacket.\r\n\r\n“All right, Hal, I’ll take ’er while you get a bite to eat.”\r\n\r\n“You better start collecting all the spare rope you can find, Dad,” I\r\nsaid to the cook as I squeezed into the diminutive galley. “Enough to\r\nlash yourself down with, too.”\r\n\r\nDad was a spry young adventurer of some seventy-two years. He had\r\nfought nearly all the Indian tribes in the Northwest, it seems, under\r\nGeneral Miles, when a young buck of eighteen, and somehow, now at the\r\nother end of the cycle, the lure had returned to him and he had taken\r\nto the water. This was his first sea job.\r\n\r\n“Gwine ter be rough, I reckon, heh? Well, let ’er come--_yerroo-oop_!”\r\nHe let out a wild war whoop. Suddenly he made a grab for the coffeepot\r\nwhich rocked wildly on the stove. We were weaving in and out of the\r\nprotecting islands between the straits and the channel.\r\n\r\n“Yeroop, yourself,” I said, hastily gulping down my coffee and making\r\nfor the door. “You’ll be using worse language than that in a mighty\r\nshort space of time.”\r\n\r\n“Heh! Git out of my kitchen!”\r\n\r\nIt was growing dark when I retook the wheel. Overhead the sky was a\r\nmottled gray-black. The wind was beginning to sing through our mast\r\nand rigging. On either side were the blurred outlines of the islands\r\nwe were hugging. In another few minutes they would be behind us, and\r\nwe would be out in the straits bucking a wind that hit us on our port\r\nquarter.\r\n\r\nThe waves were running higher now, and the boat began to pitch and roll.\r\nAhead I could faintly make out the jagged, angry outlines of the sea.\r\nThe crew had scattered. Al was down by his precious engines and Charlie\r\nhad gone with him. Milt and Ed were sitting on the bench behind me. In\r\nthe gloom I could make out the glow of their cigarettes, reflected in\r\nthe windowpanes. Bob, beside me, was peering intently through the fogged\r\nglass.\r\n\r\nCrash! Our bow shot up suddenly as if some giant hand down in the depths\r\nhad punched it. For an instant we hung there, then the sea dropped away\r\nand we lunged down into a deep gray gulley and rolled dizzily on our\r\nside; a thick, twisting wall of water crashed down on our foredeck with\r\na jarring, smashing impact and dashed up against the front of the pilot\r\nhouse.\r\n\r\nI braced myself on a cleat, hung to the wheel, and twisted it sharply\r\nto get back into the wind. Bob slipped and seized the handrail. Behind\r\nme I heard the thud of two soft bodies hitting the floor, and from the\r\ngalley came the crash and clatter of pans and dishes, mixed with the\r\nshrill treble curses of Dad.\r\n\r\nWe were out in the straits.\r\n\r\n“What’s your course now, Hal?” asked Bob, face glued straight ahead.\r\n\r\nI switched on the binnacle light and peered into our Standard Navy\r\ncompass. It was a large thing, too large for our boat; for, like a rat\r\nterrier, we pitched and plunged, rocked and rolled, with short, choppy\r\nmotions, while our instrument was fitted for a larger ship that rolled\r\nand swung with a slow wallow. I watched the card recover from a long,\r\ndeliberate swing and estimated its arc.\r\n\r\n“About north, a quarter east,” I answered. “But she’s swinging too slow\r\nto be accurate.”\r\n\r\n“Ease her off to starboard a little more. We’re headin’ way below Morey\r\nLight now.”\r\n\r\nThe wind, hurling itself through Dixon’s Entrance, fifteen miles below,\r\ncame sweeping, tearing up the straits. We were right in the teeth of it.\r\nThe singing in our mast changed to a low, ominous moan, mounted higher,\r\nbroke into a screech, then still higher, higher, into an insistent,\r\npiercing shriek.\r\n\r\n“Bob!”\r\n\r\n“Huh?”\r\n\r\n“Did we tighten up that front stay last time we was in?”\r\n\r\nThe front stay is one of the four wires supporting the mast. It runs\r\nfrom the top of the pole down to the bowsprit, where it is clamped.\r\nOften the clamps work loose, allowing the wire to swing slackly,\r\nrendering it easier for the pole to break under stress.\r\n\r\nThere was a moment’s silence. “Nope, we didn’t.”\r\n\r\n“An’ them clamps was loose, too.”\r\n\r\n“Yep,” came the succinct answer. Bob hadn’t moved an inch from the\r\nwindow in the last quarter of an hour.\r\n\r\n“If it breaks loose----”\r\n\r\nAnother dizzy roll, sending us far to the side, interrupted the\r\nsentence. The shriek of the wind crept up a note. I could just make\r\nout, directly in front of us, the twisting, contorting water. Now it\r\nwould pile up to a sharp peak and the jagged edges would be whipped\r\noff by the wind, driving against the front of the pilot house with\r\nthe sharp rattle of machine-gun bullets. Now we would meet a huge\r\nwave head on and the boat would stagger back while the spray went\r\nflying high in the air. Now we went plunging into a trough with the\r\nsickening drop of an express elevator, while the foredeck completely\r\ndisappeared from sight, buried under the seething, boiling eddies of\r\nwater. Then we would labor to the surface in time to meet another\r\nonslaught.\r\n\r\nWe were struck from the side and went reeling, careening over with our\r\nbottom half out of water and the runway on our under side completely\r\nsubmerged. I clutched the wheel tightly to keep from going smashing\r\nagainst the wall, while time and again Bob hung suspended, head and\r\nshoulders over me, for a long breathless instant, his body standing\r\nout in shadowy silhouette against the side windows. Then we righted\r\nourselves, shipping a load of water that went sweeping, sliding over\r\nthe deck and came spurting into the wheelhouse, under the doorsill.\r\nNow and then we would stand on our stern, bow completely out of water,\r\nlike an angry bear on its haunches, and the next instant we would be\r\nslammed violently against the front of the house, stern boosted up,\r\nnose deeply buried, while I twirled the wheel vainly and prayed for a\r\nspeedy recovery.\r\n\r\n“Must be wilder’n all-get-up outside the islands,” remarked Ed, as we\r\nwent hurtling down into a giant hollow.\r\n\r\n“Must be,” returned Bob, eyes glued to the pane. “Good blow here in the\r\nstraits.” We came out of the trough with a leap--high into the air we\r\nwent.\r\n\r\n“Wish I had a good hot cup of coffee,” I said after a century or so.\r\n\r\n“Huh! There ain’t nothin’ stickin’ to that stove ’ceptin’ th’ polish.\r\nChew of t’bacco help?”\r\n\r\nI could hear nothing from the kitchen; evidently there wasn’t anything\r\nleft to fall from the shelves.\r\n\r\nWe were struck sharply on the port side--another heavy impact from\r\nthe front--and over we went. Over, over--I clutched the wheel tensely\r\nand tried to take a spoke. The water came spurting through the cracks\r\nof the door. It seemed as if Bob’s whole body was suspended over me,\r\nmotionless. Some fragmentary recollection of a hanging sword came to\r\nme. An eternity we hung there, then slowly, slowly came back.\r\n\r\nEd stirred. “Bad one.” It sounded more like a whistle than an\r\narticulation of words.\r\n\r\nI heard the trapdoor open and some one struggle through, then a long,\r\nlurid, wind-swept string of oaths. “An’ ef I ever gits off’n this here\r\nlame-halted critter I’m going to reetire fer th’ rest of my life in th’\r\nmountings.”\r\n\r\n“Yeroop,” said I in a very mediocre imitation of a war whoop. I’m not\r\nvery good on war whoops.\r\n\r\nUnk! Bang! I heard all three men go crashing down against the wall. We\r\nwere thrown high into the air, stern down.\r\n\r\n“Say,” spoke up Ed, suddenly. “If our seine table should be jarred\r\noff’n its rollers it’d go overboard in about ten seconds.” Our\r\nfifteen-hundred-foot seine rested on a revolving table on the stern,\r\nwith nothing to hold it down but its own weight.\r\n\r\nBarnes shifted his gaze for the first time. “Ed, if we lose that net\r\nwe’ll go to hell in a handbasket. That’s all’s helping us to ride this\r\nblow.”\r\n\r\n“Can’t pitch much worse. We’re rollin’ our tail off now.”\r\n\r\n“That table should have been lashed.”\r\n\r\n“What’re you goin’ t’ lash it to? Hain’t nothin’ there.”\r\n\r\n“We might have passed a line around it and back to the towbitts. That\r\nwould have held it some.”\r\n\r\n“Well, mebbe.”\r\n\r\n“Only trouble is in getting back there,” continued Bob. “That deck ain’t\r\nout of water ten seconds at a stretch.”\r\n\r\n“Where’s that half inch rope we had?” Ed asked suddenly.\r\n\r\n“In the chest you’re setting on.”\r\n\r\nI heard him fumble about.\r\n\r\n“What’re you going to do?” asked Bob.\r\n\r\n“Tie it around me--you’n Milt hang to th’ other end and pay it out as I\r\ngo. I’ll try to get back there by hangin’ to the guard rail. Pull her in\r\nwhen I holler.”\r\n\r\n“Won’t hear you--too much noise.”\r\n\r\n“Well, keep your eyes peeled.”\r\n\r\n“Can’t see.”\r\n\r\n“Well, dang it, use your judgment!”\r\n\r\nWe lurched over on our side and he had to wait a minute or so before\r\ndaring to open the door.\r\n\r\n“Any relations you want me to notify?” I asked, spinning a useless\r\nwheel.\r\n\r\n“Go to----” the rest of it was lost in a hurricane of wind, noise, and\r\nsalt water that tore in as he opened the door. It literally blew him\r\nbackward. He caught himself, tried again, got outside, then we lost him\r\nin the angry blackness. Bob and Milt paid out the rope slowly, both\r\nhanging to the handrail and braced against the door to hold it partly\r\nopen.\r\n\r\nAgain we shot up into the air, hung, and slid drunkenly back into a\r\nblack abyss. The two men pulled frantically at the rope, dragging Ed\r\nback by main force, jerking him inside, and slamming the door just as\r\na huge mountain came crowding, spilling over our side.\r\n\r\n“No use, can’t be done,” panted Ed. I could hear the water cascade from\r\nhis clothes.\r\n\r\nIt was absolutely dark now. We were in a vast empire of blackness,\r\nfilled with millions of weird, screaming voices.\r\n\r\nSuddenly I heard, in the rhythmical throb of the engines below me, a\r\ncatch, a cylinder missed fire, coughed, and caught the rhythm once\r\nagain. In that moment my heart lost a beat, and I know I must have\r\ncried out some unintelligible thing to the gloom.\r\n\r\nTo be buffeted about in a vast inky inferno of tumult, not knowing\r\nwhere one is, not knowing what reef is ahead of one, not knowing what\r\nthe next wave will do, not knowing when some part of the rigging will\r\nbreak, is a trying situation. Yet the powerful, sturdy engines are\r\ndriving on and on, fighting the waves blow for blow, keeping the boat\r\nin the face of the wind, pushing forward toward a calm harbor, foot\r\nby foot. And from that dogged persistence men take courage. But when\r\nthey stop, the only weapon against the elements gone, something sinks\r\nand dies out in a man’s heart.\r\n\r\nThere is always a lurking fear in the mind of those who go out to sea\r\nin gas boats that they may develop engine trouble, in bad weather. Gas\r\nengines are not the most dependable means of locomotion.\r\n\r\nThe gloom was beginning to stifle me. My nerves were on edge. I checked\r\na panicky impulse to swing the wheel hard over to where I thought land\r\nought to be. I was beginning to doubt the compass. Back of me I heard\r\nthe clock sound eight bells, twelve o’clock, midnight. We had been out\r\nsix hours on a trip that ordinarily took two, and hadn’t yet picked up\r\nthe far-away glimmer of the beacon that marked out the entrance into\r\ncalmer, quieter waters.\r\n\r\nBob was peering into the sweeping, whistling, shrieking blackness.\r\n\r\n“Course now, Hal?”\r\n\r\n“North, a quarter east, about.”\r\n\r\nHe moved impatiently. “Ought to have picked up Morey Light long ago.”\r\n\r\n“Don’t suppose the dang thing’s still on the bum, do you?” queried Ed,\r\ngroping his way forward and wiping clear a place on the foggy pane.\r\n\r\nMorey Rock Light had been out of order for a month or more and we had\r\nconstantly notified the superintendent of the Light Service at Ketchikan\r\nabout it.\r\n\r\n“Shouldn’t be. We sure are out of luck if it is. Blow’s taken us ’way\r\noff our course; must be somewhere near Kiegan’s Chuck. If we can’t\r\npick up that Light we’ll have to beat up and down here all night--and\r\ntake our chances.”\r\n\r\nBoth men pressed their faces against the windowpanes.\r\n\r\nI swung the wheel to port after coming out of a trough and tried to\r\nforce all my energy into one intense gaze that would bore a hole\r\nthrough the blackness. But my eyes were tired and the lids burned in an\r\nirritating fashion. My arms were bruised and sore. With each successive\r\npitch and roll of the boat my weary leg muscles responded less readily.\r\nI was tired, so darned tired! With a supreme effort I nursed the spokes\r\nover and dug my feet into the deck cleats as we made another sickening,\r\ndizzy sideward roll. Then through half consciousness I heard a voice\r\nclose to me.\r\n\r\n“Hell, Hal, I plumb fergot. You been wrassling that wheel for six\r\nhours.” Ed grasped the spokes. “Lemme have it. You better see if you\r\ncan’t grab off a couple of winks.”\r\n\r\nI came out of a doze, pried stiff, cramped fingers loose from the\r\nwooden spokes and lurched, stumbled backward, feeling for the bench.\r\nI steered around it, crouched down on the wet floor, braced my back\r\nagainst the bench and my feet against the wall. A long roll swung\r\nthe boat over again until I was lying almost on my back, feet high\r\nin the air. Suddenly I didn’t care a hang if the boat floated or\r\nsank. Too tired. But before I went to sleep a satisfying thought\r\ncame to me. Outside the cabin nature had let loose all the violent\r\nelements in her box of tricks, all against this little boat pitching\r\nand tossing drunkenly on a sea of monstrous ridges and abysmal\r\nvalleys, zigzagging crazily through a night as black as the pit,\r\nrolling and heeling to a wind that ripped up oceans; while inside\r\nthe pilot house, an insignificant cell of quietness in all this riot\r\nof fury and noise, seven pigmies stared through flimsy glass windows\r\nand defied all the combined efforts of the elements of turmoil. The\r\nlast words I heard were:\r\n\r\n“Now where in _hell_ is that Light?”\r\n\r\nIt was a boat with an exceedingly clean deck that came chugging into\r\nCannery Inlet about eight in the morning, a boat with a crew one\r\nthird awake. We scraped four pilings and crashed through a rowboat\r\nfloat before docking at the fish conveyor. We heard exclamations of\r\nwonder as we threw out our lines. About us we could see traces of\r\nlast night’s storm on the beach, even in this haven.\r\n\r\n“Gosh, man! You didn’t come across in _that_ storm?”\r\n\r\nBob lit his pipe and turned a sleep-laden face to the inquirer, the\r\ncannery owner. Then he climbed into his bunk, clothes, boots, pipe and\r\nall.\r\n\r\n“_Unhuh._ Li’l bit rough.” And he dropped off to sleep in the man’s\r\nface.\r\n\r\nBack in the galley I could hear the old cook making breakfast to the\r\ntune of an exceedingly ribald old song:\r\n\r\n    “Oh, were yez ever in an Irishman’s shanty,\r\n    Where money was scarce and whisky waz planty----”\r\n\r\nThe owner turned to the rest of the group. “But wasn’t it rough?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, it blowed some,” said Ed, making for his bunk in the fo’c’s’lehead.\r\n\r\n“Rather rough,” added Milt, which was his second statement since leaving\r\nKetchikan the night before.\r\n\r\nCharlie, fat, bald, and German, smiled wisely and made for the kitchen,\r\nfrom which came the odor of fried ham.\r\n\r\n“Um,” said I, trying to straddle the fence. I would like to have\r\nenlarged on that trip. I felt it deserved grander treatment. It needed\r\nan epic strophe and sonorous epithets. But how could a blasé old sea\r\ndog of twenty-one do so without losing caste? I followed Charlie into\r\nthe galley for breakfast.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Transcriber’s Note: This story appeared in the January 5, 1923 issue\r\nof _Sea Stories Magazine_.]"

Dot—“Fire!”\r\n\r\nBy Clarice Detzer\r\n\r\nIllustrations by Robb Beebe\r\n\r\n\r\nCaptain Eli James, commander of Whitefish Bay coast guard station,\r\nslammed his big right hand down on the desk and agreed enthusiastically.\r\n\r\n“It’s what Edna needs, and she’ll do it!” he sang out. “That gal’s been\r\nhanging around life saving stations too long. Sure, and I can see it!\r\nAll her life, leastwise since I’ve had the care of her, she’s been stuck\r\noff at the end o’ creation with a parcel o’ life savers, and not another\r\ngal her age in twenty miles. She’ll go, this time.” He looked around\r\nchallengingly at the men of his crew. “Think you fellows can get along\r\n’thout her for a short time?” he demanded.\r\n\r\nMiss Mills, captain of the Whitefish City Girl Scout troop, arose\r\nbriskly.\r\n\r\n“It’s agreed,” she said. “It’ll do her good, Captain. Getting out with\r\nother girls will make Edna less....” she checked herself quickly. She\r\nhad started to say “less awkward.”\r\n\r\n“Make her a great deal more happy,” she amended. It would never do to\r\ncall Edna James awkward before this adoring uncle.\r\n\r\n“Happy’s what I want,” Captain James said.\r\n\r\n“And by jumpin’ whales, you deserve it!” he told Edna heartily that\r\nnight. “All work and no play makes Jack a dull sailor boy.” He rumpled\r\nup her short brown hair affectionately. “Get your outfit ready,” he\r\ncommanded. “Anybody steerin’ out o’ Whitefish Bay has to look slick.”\r\n\r\nAnd so it happened that on the first Friday evening in August, Edna\r\nJames went into camp at Cummings Point with fifteen other members of\r\nGirl Scout Troop Number One, none of whom she knew. They had ridden\r\nsince noon, to the end of a little logging railroad, and then carried\r\ntheir gear a mile across grassy hills to the beach. Now, at five\r\no’clock, the three brown duck tents had been pitched, kettles swung over\r\nthe blazing fires of the two patrols, and camp routine had begun. Two of\r\nthe girls were digging a well on the sandy beach, four Tenderfoot Girl\r\nScouts were bringing in driftwood, the patrol leaders were overseeing\r\nthe supper arrangements, and Edna James, feeling very miserable and very\r\nworthless, was searching for something to do.\r\n\r\n“What are _you_ looking so disconsolate about?” Miss Mills demanded when\r\nshe came in from her first inspection trip. “Why, you look just like a\r\npoor little lost lamb.”\r\n\r\nEdna did not reply at once, only swallowed hard. She was a short,\r\nstocky, brown-skinned girl, just turned sixteen, with blue eyes that\r\nmade a habit of squinting, eyes that had spent their whole life peering\r\nout into the wide blowy spaces of Lake Michigan.\r\n\r\n“I don’t know....” she laughed uncomfortably. “I don’t know my duties. I\r\nfeel useless. I don’t know what to do next.”\r\n\r\n“Help the girls get in driftwood,” the troop captain suggested briskly.\r\n“We’ll need a lot of it. Nights are cold up here.”\r\n\r\nEdna obeyed willingly. She knew all about cold nights. And cold days,\r\ntoo, for that matter. Work at the coast guard station was no respecter\r\nof weather. Day and night, winter and summer, the eight men of her\r\nuncle’s crew must take turns patrolling the rocky coast, and standing\r\nlook-out in a queer little box of a room high on stilts upon the beach.\r\nA dozen times, with the wind screaming out of the Northwest and breakers\r\nthundering against the shore, Edna had climbed up to the lookout tower\r\nand watched her uncle Eli and his men launch their boats against the\r\nbellowing wrath of the lake, to come in, hours later, bringing a handful\r\nof thankful, frosted sailors. And a hundred times in calmer weather, she\r\nhad stood watch while they searched for lost boats and vessels and\r\nmissing pleasure craft.\r\n\r\nEdna knew her duty then, all right! She must keep a sharp eye on the\r\nlake for signals. Must listen for the telephone. Must get hot fires\r\nroaring in the stoves. Must get out dry blankets, make up emergency beds\r\nfor survivors, should there be any. Must notify coast guard stations\r\nnorth and south that there was a wreck. Must call a doctor. And must\r\nmake coffee, great, strong, steaming pots of it, blacker than midnight,\r\nand have it bubbling when the men come in. If the wet, winded crew\r\nshould return to quarters and find no hot coffee, no dry clothes\r\nawaiting them, Edna James would have fallen down on her job, that was\r\nall!\r\n\r\nSitting around the great fire that evening, Edna found it hard to join\r\nthe conversation. The girls talked of things about which she knew\r\nnothing. Helen Thomas, her patrol leader, had spent the winter in Italy.\r\nEdna discovered that she was not familiar with Italian art, or gondolas\r\non the Grand Canal, or the curve of the Bay of Naples, or any of the\r\nother subjects Helen was mentioning so lightly. She sat back\r\nuncomfortably while talk drifted to cars, dancing, parties, to the\r\nintimate life of the little city of Whitefish, and back again to\r\ncars ... straight eights, coupés, miles per gallon, to rides into the\r\ncountry, to traffic in cities.\r\n\r\n“Must be hard driving in sand down to your station,” a girl said to\r\nEdna. It was Bess Henry, the youngest, and prettiest girl in either\r\ntroop.\r\n\r\n“I’ve never driven a car,” Edna admitted.\r\n\r\n“Never drove! You mean you don’t know _how_?”\r\n\r\n“No,” Edna confessed. She felt her cheeks coloring. “I don’t know how. I\r\ncan sail a boat ... any small boat....”\r\n\r\n“When we were at Miami,” Ruth Berger broke in, “we sailed a lot. A\r\nfriend of Dad’s had a steam yacht....”\r\n\r\nBut this wasn’t the kind of sailing Edna understood. However, she found\r\nthat time helped. She could listen with more interest. She became more\r\naccustomed to camp life after that first day. In one thing she\r\nexcelled--she could swim. No matter how high the surf, she could tumble\r\nout into it, and swim far away from the others. The third day, when a\r\nvillager towed a diving raft down from town and anchored it opposite the\r\ncamp, according to Miss Mills’ directions, it was Bess Henry who first\r\nclimbed the short ladder ... and dived like a swooping gull. Edna never\r\nhad considered it important to be able to dive. It was swimming, good\r\nold-fashioned swimming, she had learned from her uncle Eli and the men\r\nof the coast guard crew. Although she could swim better than any other\r\ngirl in camp, her diving was awkward.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: No matter how high the surf. Edna could tumble into it\r\nand swim far away from the others.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: But it was Bess Henry who first climbed the short ladder\r\nand dove like a swooping gull. Edna could not dive.]\r\n\r\nShe found that she got tired on the first hike, miserably and\r\nunbelievably tired. But she gritted her teeth and stuck it out. Stayed\r\nright through to the end, and next morning could hardly move her feet.\r\nIn camp life, in first aid, in cooking, in the thousand details she did\r\nvery well ... not brilliantly, understand, just very well.\r\n\r\n“I’m not a complete failure,” she wrote her uncle Eli, “nor complete\r\nsuccess. I merely get on!”\r\n\r\nOn the fourth day she was elected to remain behind as camp watchman\r\nwhile the others hiked in the woods. Each day someone must stay, to\r\nprotect the camp from chipmunks and rabbits and porcupines and other\r\nsmall marauders. The assignment pleased her, to the surprise of the\r\nother girls. Loneliness held no terrors for her.\r\n\r\nIt was midmorning when she heard a step on the path; it was early for\r\nthe girls to be returning.\r\n\r\nBeyond the ashes of last night’s fire, looking critically over the camp\r\nsite, stood a rather heavy, middle-aged man in a checked golf suit. He\r\napproached Edna deliberately.\r\n\r\n“This _your_ outfit?” he demanded. He spoke harshly.\r\n\r\n“Whitefish Troop Girl Scouts,” Edna replied. She did not like the scowl\r\non his red face.\r\n\r\n“You the girls that have been wandering all over my property up there?”\r\nthe man asked. He waved toward the north. “Making yourselves at home?”\r\n\r\n“I don’t know anything about your property,” Edna answered. Life at a\r\ncoast guard station had taught her to respond quickly when spoken to,\r\nand she knew well enough that decent men sometimes had rough voices. But\r\nbefore she could continue the stranger said:\r\n\r\n“Well, I’ll tell you something about it, young lady. This is my property\r\nright here where you’re standing. Bought it yesterday. Bought it to keep\r\ncampers off. To get rid of outfits like this. My name’s Vanbalken. I run\r\nthe Ridge View Hotel up the shore. Guests are complaining. Say you’re\r\nwandering all over the place.”\r\n\r\nEdna waited politely until he was through talking.\r\n\r\n“Miss Mills is our captain,” she explained. “You’d better see her.\r\nShe’ll be back soon. Do you mind waiting?”\r\n\r\n“I can’t wait. Too busy to worry about trespassers. If she wanted to\r\ncamp, she ought to have asked permission.”\r\n\r\n“She got permission.”\r\n\r\n“From the other owners. Weeks ago, before I bought it. Not from _me_.”\r\n\r\n“She wouldn’t have come if she’d known you didn’t want us. Of course we\r\ncan move ... in an hour....”\r\n\r\n“Who said anything about moving?” Again he surveyed the camp. “But keep\r\naway from the golf links. It annoys the golfers to have a lot of girls\r\ntramping down the fairway.”\r\n\r\nHe went off growling, without so much as a nod over his shoulder. Edna\r\nwatched him with growing anger. At least he could have been less like a\r\nbear. She laughed when she thought that Mr. Vanbalken never could have\r\nwon a merit badge for performing the duties of a hostess properly. She\r\nwondered if she had been as tactful as she should have been.\r\n\r\nAt noon when the troop returned, Edna had the fires blazing, the\r\nskillets hot, and a great kettle of water boiling. She had cleaned up\r\nthe camp site, had raked the coarse sand grass, had drawn water from the\r\nshallow well on the sandy beach, had washed and hung out the kitchen\r\ntowels. They were drying rapidly. Wind, that had been direct westerly at\r\ndaybreak, had shifted to the northwest by ten o’clock. Clouds were\r\nrolling in from the lake. The water turned green, with streaks of drab.\r\n\r\nEdna told Miss Mills at once of the morning visitor; to her surprise,\r\nthe troop captain seemed disturbed.\r\n\r\n“Vanbalken?” she asked. “Yes, I know him. His hotel’s a full mile from\r\nhere. He’s a queer sort. But as to owning this place....”\r\n\r\n“He said he’d bought it just to keep trespassers off.”\r\n\r\n“I’ll have to see him this afternoon,” Miss Mills said.\r\n\r\n“This afternoon?”\r\n\r\n“Why not?”\r\n\r\n“There’s a squall coming,” Edna predicted. She had watched preparations\r\nfor a storm often enough at the coast guard station to know the ugly\r\nsymptoms. “Going to blow hard before night.”\r\n\r\n“That’ll be interesting,” Bess Henry cried. “I’d like to be out in a\r\nreal storm ... camping, I mean!”\r\n\r\nEdna stared at her unbelievingly. “You really want to?” she asked.\r\n\r\n“Of course!” Bess Henry answered. “Wouldn’t you?”\r\n\r\nEdna shook her head. “No ... no, I wouldn’t,” she admitted.\r\n\r\n“Afraid?” Bess Henry asked. Her tone was slightly superior.\r\n\r\nEdna flushed. Afraid? She hadn’t thought of that!\r\n\r\n“Well, hardly,” she answered with some heat. She thought swiftly of all\r\nthe times she’d walked the beach in storms so ferocious that the life\r\nboat had been beaten back to shore. One learned to have no liking for\r\nstorms at a coast guard station ... storms that meant sunken ships,\r\ndrowned crews, wet, tired, winded coast guardsmen. “I’m not afraid,” she\r\nrepeated stoutly.\r\n\r\n“Afraid?” echoed the troop captain. “Why, she lives at a coast guard\r\nstation, Bess!” Miss Mills changed the subject quickly. “I’m going over\r\nto the hotel to talk to Edna’s caller, now,” she said. “I’d planned\r\nsignal practice this afternoon.” She paused, thinking. “We’ll have it\r\nanyway,” she decided. She looked at Edna. “Can you wigwag?”\r\n\r\nEdna nodded. She knew what was in Miss Mills’ mind. She was wondering\r\nwhether to leave her again as guard or send her out with the others. She\r\nnever had joined the girls in signal practice; never had told them that\r\nshe knew signaling, both wigwag and semaphore.\r\n\r\n“I can signal a little.”\r\n\r\nMiss Mills turned to Helen. “I suggest you put Edna on that hill,” she\r\ndirected. “Stay in sight of camp, Edna. The rest of the girls will\r\nstretch out on the beach. Sure you know the signals, Edna?”\r\n\r\n“I ought to,” Edna answered. She stooped to retie her canvas shoes\r\nwithout explaining what she meant. Couldn’t drive a car. Couldn’t dive.\r\nCouldn’t talk about Italy. And therefore couldn’t wigwag? Her cheeks\r\nwere hot as she started up the hill. Maybe she’d never heard of straight\r\neights, but she knew how to signal with flags. Captain Eli James had\r\ntaught her that much!\r\n\r\nShe came out breathlessly into the open, where a sloping field lifted\r\ngently to the ridge. The sod was neat here, as if it had been cropped by\r\nsheep. From the great height to which she had climbed, she had a wide\r\nview of land and of Lake Michigan. Behind, and not a mile off, loomed\r\nthe red roofs of a hotel ... the Ridge View, no doubt, whose owner was\r\ncausing Miss Mills such uneasiness. Men and women in gay, colorful\r\nclothes wandered aimlessly below her. She turned her attention south,\r\nwhere the sky looked stormy.\r\n\r\nOther hillocks arose over the landscape, lake-shore dunes covered with\r\nsecond-growth timber or bare humps of sand. On the nearest of these\r\nHelen Thomas had taken her post. She waved one of her flags. Edna\r\nspelled out the words:\r\n\r\n“A r e  y o u  r e a d y?”\r\n\r\n“Y e s,” Edna answered.\r\n\r\nAgain she waited. How slow they were. The storm rolled closer. Cars\r\nbegan to scurry on the hotel road. The men and women in gay blazers on\r\nthe rolling fields below Edna’s hilltop were rushing for shelter. Edna\r\nwatched the clouds dubiously.\r\n\r\nHelen Thomas was waving again.\r\n\r\n“A t t e n t i o n!” the red and white flags in her hand signaled\r\nrepeatedly. Edna replied. Behind the patrol leader black clouds made a\r\ndark background. She began to spell slowly with one flag ... left and\r\nright, with short arcs.\r\n\r\n“A l l  r e a d y!”\r\n\r\nEdna replied, whipping her own flag rapidly.\r\n\r\n“Hey, there!” an angry voice cried behind her.\r\n\r\nShe glanced backward. Two men and a woman stood at the foot of the hill.\r\nThey were shouting at her, waving their arms. “Fore!”\r\n\r\nBeyond them a fourth figure was walking rapidly toward her. She\r\nrecognized him at once. It was her visitor of the morning, Mr.\r\nVanbalken, the hotel owner. His red face was redder. He was shaking his\r\nfist as he climbed up to her. Edna was tempted to run. She realized too\r\nlate she must be on the golf course.\r\n\r\n“You!” Vanbalken shouted. He was puffing hard. “How many times must I\r\ntell you to keep off?”\r\n\r\n“I&#039;m sorry....” Edna began. She looked hastily toward her patrol leader.\r\nShe mustn&#039;t fumble this signaling! They’d say she couldn’t even wigwag!\r\n\r\n“You ought to be sorry!” the man cried. “Didn&#039;t I warn you this morning?\r\nAnd your chaperon, whatever you call her, down there not half an hour\r\nago promising to keep you off the links!”\r\n\r\n“I didn&#039;t know this was your links.”\r\n\r\n“And she didn&#039;t know that was my ground where you’re camping! I’m\r\nthrough! Off you go! You and your camp and all this fol-de-rol!”\r\n\r\nA flash of lightning interrupted him. It spit out of the rolling black\r\ncloud and thrust a long, blue-white finger into the dark pitching waters\r\nof the lake. Edna glanced across the lowlands to the opposite hill.\r\nHelen Thomas was waving her flag frantically. “P a y  a t t e n t i o n”\r\nshe was signaling.\r\n\r\nRain spattered in large drops upon the close-cropped grass. “I’m sorry,”\r\nEdna began again. But Vanbalken had left at the first lightning. He was\r\ntramping rapidly down the hill now, forty feet away, and not looking\r\nback. The rain drops were smaller and fell with a cold, biting\r\nintensity. The black cloud rolled directly overhead.\r\n\r\nEdna glanced up at it. Even in the moment she saw a burst of fire in its\r\nmidst, saw the white flaming arm of lightning strike down from the sky.\r\nShe heard a terrific crash, like a burst of dynamite.\r\n\r\nAt the foot of the slope, and midway to the Ridge View, other lightnings\r\nran backward and forward along the ground. An electric line had taken\r\nthe shock.\r\n\r\nEdna, her ears aching with the report, saw Vanbalken halt, saw him start\r\nrunning toward the hotel, then halt again.\r\n\r\nA cloud of yellow smoke puffed up among the birch trees below the hotel\r\nroof. Wind whipped it along the tree tops. New smoke piled in its place.\r\n\r\nVanbalken saw it even before she did.\r\n\r\n“Fire!” he shouted. “Fire!”\r\n\r\nWas he talking to her? Edna started to run. New smoke clouds, yellow\r\nagainst the black sky, rolled upward through the rain. Edna halted. What\r\nwas she doing? She couldn’t help down there. And hadn’t emergency been\r\nher daily fare, all her sixteen years? Hadn’t she seen her uncle and the\r\nmen of his crew face it calmly, every time? “Afraid of storms?” Bess\r\nHenry had asked her.\r\n\r\nSwiftly she turned back to the hill. Helen Thomas was deserting the\r\nother hilltop. Edna whipped up her signal flags. The patrol leader\r\nlooked once, halted, ran back and waved in reply. Down on the beach\r\nother girls, out of Edna’s view, were ready to give up the practice.\r\nThere was nothing in the code book that said they must wigwag in rain!\r\n\r\nLeft and right Edna swished her flag, spelling out quick dots and\r\ndashes. Helen would have to read fast!\r\n\r\nDot-dot-dash-dot ... dot-dot ...  dot-dash-dot ... dot.\r\n\r\nThen a pause. And on again.\r\n\r\nF i r e  a t  R i d g e  V i e w....\r\n\r\nHelen wagged once, turned her back, and began to relay the message. Ten\r\nseconds it had taken Edna. In fifteen more Helen had finished. It\r\ncarried along the beach ... Edna waited nervously. It must reach Miss\r\nMills at the post office in time to send help!\r\n\r\nQuickly, with her red and white flags under her arm, Edna started toward\r\nthe hotel. Panting, she sped over the cropped grass. Men were carrying\r\nbuckets across the hotel porch. And down the wind a new sound was\r\nwhining, the shrill cry of a fire department siren. A crimson truck\r\nswung into the grounds.\r\n\r\nThe message had gone through. Cummings Harbor had sent aid!\r\n\r\nThe engine hummed. The thrash of a stream sounded above the noise of\r\nstorm and fire. Edna charged up the steps. She was conscious of Helen\r\nThomas running breathlessly behind her. Guests, in panic, were dragging\r\ntrunks to the porch. Two boys carried a girl out.\r\n\r\n“Hurt?” Edna cried.\r\n\r\n“Shock ... telephone operator ... switchboard blew to pieces....”\r\n\r\n“First aid, Helen!” Edna said. “Girl has electric shock!”\r\n\r\nTwenty minutes later, when the captain of the Whitefish City Troop\r\narrived in a car commandeered in town, volunteer firemen were rolling up\r\ntheir wet hose and the wide lobby was clearing of smoke. It was\r\nVanbalken who reached Miss Mills first. Before Edna or Helen could\r\nspeak, he had taken her aside and was talking rapidly. She shook her\r\nhead once; Vanbalken shook his.\r\n\r\n“Cold!” Edna heard him say, and then: “Plenty of room....”\r\n\r\nA wet, breathless girl in a wrinkled uniform staggered up the steps. It\r\nwas Bess Henry, the guard, who had been left at camp.\r\n\r\n“Camp blew down!” she sobbed. “Did my best ... the wind....”\r\n\r\n“The wind just helped evict us,” Miss Mills said. “We’re put out, girls.\r\nBut Mr. Vanbalken has asked us here as his guests ... here ... yes, for\r\ndinner ... and for the night. Till our outfits dry out. And he asks us\r\nto camp there again next year ... certainly he does. He wishes to\r\napologize in the meantime. Particularly to you, Edna. Oh, yes, he\r\nunderstands it all. And I want to congratulate you too. You’re certainly\r\nnot ...” she turned quickly, searching the group.\r\n\r\n“Bess Henry, I call you to witness. Edna James is not afraid of storms!”\r\n\r\n\r\n[Transcriber’s Note: This story appeared in the August, 1929 issue of\r\n_The American Girl_ magazine.]"

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\r\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\r\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\r\npeople in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\r\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\r\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf.\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 3.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\r\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\r\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\r\nparticular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\r\nTo donate, please visit:\r\nhttp://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\r\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\r\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\r\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\r\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\r\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\r\n\r\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks."

Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\r\nthe U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _The little man dared to venture into the realm of the\r\nGods--but the Gods were cruel!_]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe early morning streetcar, swaying and rattling along its tracks, did\r\nas much to divert my attention from the book I was reading as the\r\ncontents of the book itself. I did not like Plato. Comfortable though\r\nthe seat was, I was as uncomfortable as any collegiate could be whose\r\nmind would rather dwell upon tomorrow's football game than the immediate\r\ntask in hand--the morning session with Professor Russell and the book on\r\nmy lap.\r\n\r\nMy gaze wandered from the book and drifted out the distorted window,\r\nthen fell to the car-sill as I thought over Plato's conclusions.\r\nSomething moving on the ledge attracted my attention: it was a scurrying\r\nblack ant. If I had thought about it, I might have wondered how it came\r\nthere. But the next moment a more curious object on the sill caught my\r\neye. I bent over.\r\n\r\nI couldn't make out what it was at first. A bug, perhaps. Maybe it was\r\ntoo small for a bug. Just a little dancing dust, no doubt.\r\n\r\nThen I discerned--and gasped. On the sill, there----it was a man! A man\r\non the streetcar's window sill----a _little_ man! He was so tiny I would\r\nnever have seen him if it hadn't been for his white attire, which made\r\nhim visible against the brown grain of the shellacked wood. I watched,\r\namazed as his microscopic figure moved over perhaps half an inch.\r\n\r\nHe wore a blouse and shorts, it seemed, and sandals. Something might\r\nhave been hanging at his side, but it was too small for me to make out\r\nplainly. His head, I thought was silver-coloured, and I think the\r\nheadgear had some sort of knobs on it. All this, of course, I didn't\r\ncatch at the time, because my heart was hammering away excitedly and\r\nmaking my fingers shake as I fumbled for a matchbox in my pocket, I\r\npushed it open and let the matches scatter out. Then, as gently as my\r\nexcitement would allow, I pushed the tiny man from the ledge into the\r\nbox; for I had suddenly realized the greatness of this amazing\r\ndiscovery.\r\n\r\nThe car was barely half-filled and no attention had been directed my\r\nway. I slid quickly out of the empty seat and hurriedly alighted at the\r\nnext stop.\r\n\r\nIn a daze, I stood where I had alighted waiting for the next No. 10 that\r\nwould return me home, the matchbox held tightly in my hand. They'd put\r\nthat box in a museum one day!\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nI collect stamps--I've heard about getting rare ones with inverted\r\ncenters, or some minor deviation that made them immensely valuable. I'd\r\nimagined getting one by mistake sometime that would make me rich. But\r\nthis! They'd billed \"King Kong\" as \"The Eighth Wonder of the World,\" but\r\nthat was only imaginary--a film ... a terrifying thought crossed my\r\nmind. I pushed open the box hastily: maybe _I_ had been dreaming. But\r\nthere it was--the unbelievable; the Little Man!\r\n\r\nA car was before me, just leaving. Its polished surface had not\r\nreflected through the haze, and the new design made so little noise that\r\nI hadn't seen it. I jumped for it, my mind in such a turmoil that the\r\nconductor had to ask three times for my fare. Ordinarily, I would have\r\nbeen embarrassed, but a young man with his mind on millions doesn't\r\nworry about little things like that. At least, not this young man.\r\n\r\nHow I acted on the streetcar, or traversed the five blocks from the end\r\nof the line, I couldn't say. If I may imagine myself, though, I must\r\nhave strode along the street like a determined machine. I reached the\r\nhouse and let myself into the basement room. Inside, I pulled the shades\r\ntogether and closed the door, the matchbox still in my hand. No one was\r\nat home this time of day, which pleased me particularly, for I wanted to\r\nfigure out how I was going to present this wonder to the world.\r\n\r\nI flung myself down on the bed and opened the matchbox. The little man\r\nlay very still on the bottom.\r\n\r\n\"Little Man!\" I cried, and turned him out on the quilt. Maybe he had\r\nsuffocated in the box. Irrational thought! Small though it might be to\r\nme, the little box was as big as all outdoors to him. It was the bumping\r\nabout he'd endured; I hadn't been very thoughtful of him.\r\n\r\nHe was reviving now, and raised himself on one arm. I pushed myself off\r\nthe bed, and stepped quickly to my table to procure something with which\r\nI could control him. Not that he could get away, but he was so tiny I\r\nthought I might lose sight of him.\r\n\r\nPen, pencil, paper, stamps, scissors, clips--none of them were what I\r\nwanted. I had nothing definite in mind, but then remembered my stamp\r\noutfit and rushed to secure it. Evidently college work had cramped my\r\nstyle along the collecting line, for the tweezers and magnifier appeared\r\nwith a mild coating of dust. But they were what I needed, and I blew on\r\nthem and returned to the bed.\r\n\r\nThe little man had made his way half an inch or so from his former\r\nprison; was crawling over what I suppose were, to him, great uneven\r\nblocks of red and green and black moss.\r\n\r\nHe crossed from a red into a black patch as I watched his movements\r\nthrough the glass, and I could see him more plainly against the darker\r\nbackground. He stopped and picked at the substance of his strange\r\nsurroundings, then straightened to examine a tuft of the cloth. The\r\nmagnifier enlarged him to a seeming half inch or so, and I could see\r\nbetter, now, this strange tiny creature.\r\n\r\nIt _was_ a metal cap he wore, and it did have protruding knobs--two of\r\nthem--slanting at 45 degree angles from his temples like horns. I\r\nwondered at their use, but it was impossible for me to imagine. Perhaps\r\nthey covered some actual growth; he might have had real horns for all I\r\nknew. Nothing would have been too strange to expect.\r\n\r\nHis clothing showed up as a simple, white, one piece garment, like a\r\nshirt and gym shorts. The shorts ended at the knee, and from there down\r\nhe was bare except for a covering on his feet which appeared more like\r\ngloves than shoes. Whatever he wore to protect his feet, it allowed free\r\nmovement of his toes.\r\n\r\nIt struck me that this little man's native habitat must have been very\r\nwarm. His attire suggested this. For a moment I considered plugging in\r\nmy small heater; my room certainly had no tropical or sub-tropical\r\ntemperature at that time of the morning--and how was I to know whether\r\nhe shivered when he felt chill. Maybe he blew his horns. Anyway, I\r\nfigured a living Eighth Wonder would be more valuable than a dead one;\r\nand I didn't think he could be stuffed. But somehow I forgot it in my\r\ninterest in examining this unusual personage.\r\n\r\nThe little man had dropped the cloth now, and was staring in my\r\ndirection. Of course, \"my direction\" was very general to him; but he\r\nseemed to be conscious of me. He certainly impressed _me_ as being\r\nawfully different, but what his reactions were, I didn't know.\r\n\r\nBut someone else knew.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn a world deep down in Smallness, in an electron of a dead cell of a\r\npiece of wood, five scientists were grouped before a complicated\r\ninstrument with a horn like the early radios. Two sat and three stood,\r\nbut their attention upon the apparatus was unanimous. From small\r\nhollowed cups worn on their fingers like rings, came a smoke from\r\nburning incense. These cups they held to their noses frequently, and\r\ntheir eyes shone as they inhaled. The scientists of infra-smallness were\r\nsmoking!\r\n\r\nWith the exception of a recent prolonged silence, which was causing them\r\ngreat anxiety, sounds had been issuing from the instrument for days.\r\nThere had been breaks before, but this silence had been long-enduring.\r\n\r\nNow the voice was speaking again; a voice that was a telepathic\r\ncommunication made audible. The scientists brightened.\r\n\r\n\"There is much that I cannot understand,\" it said. The words were\r\nhesitant, filled with awe. \"I seem to have been in many worlds. At the\r\ncompletion of my experiment, I stood on a land which was brown and black\r\nand very rough of surface. With startling suddenness, I was propelled\r\nacross this harsh country, and, terrifyingly, I was falling. I must have\r\ndropped seventy-five feet, but the strange buoyant atmosphere of this\r\nstrange world saved me from harm.\r\n\r\n\"My new surroundings were grey and gloomy, and the earth trembled as a\r\ngiant cloud passed over the sky. I do not know what it meant, but with\r\nthe suddenness characteristic of this place, it became very dark, and an\r\ninexplicable violence shook me into insensibility.\r\n\r\n\"I am conscious, now, of some giant form before me, but it is so\r\ncolossal that my eyes cannot focus it. And it changes. Now I seem\r\nconfronted by great orange mountains with curving ledges cut into their\r\nsides. Atop them are great, greyish slabs of protecting opaque rock--a\r\ncovering like that above our Temples of Aerat--'on which the rain may\r\nnever fall.' I wish that you might communicate with me, good men of my\r\nworld. How go the Gods?\r\n\r\n\"But now! These mountains are lifting, vanishing from my sight. A great\r\n_thing_ which I cannot comprehend hovers before me. It has many colors,\r\nbut mostly there is the orange of the mountains. It hangs in the air,\r\nand from the portion nearest me grow dark trees as round as myself and\r\nas tall. There is a great redness above, that opens like the Katus\r\nflower, exposing the ivory white from which puffs the Tongue of Death.\r\nBeyond this I cannot see well, but ever so high are two gigantic caverns\r\nfrom which the Winds of the Legends blow--and suck. As dangerous as the\r\nKatus, by Dal! Alternately they crush me to the ground, then threaten to\r\ntear me from it and hurl me away.\"\r\n\r\n_My nose was the cavern from which issued the horrifying wind. I noticed\r\nthat my breath distressed the little man as I leaned over to stare at\r\nhim, so drew back._\r\n\r\n_Upstairs, the visor buzzed. Before answering, so that I would not lose\r\nthe little man, I very gingerly pinched his shirt with the tongs, and\r\nlifted him to the table._\r\n\r\n\"My breath! I am shot into the heavens like Milo and his rocket! I\r\ntraverse a frightful distance! Everything changes constantly. A million\r\nmiles below is chaos. This world is mad! A giant landscape passes\r\nbeneath me, so weird I cannot describe it. I--I cannot understand. Only\r\nmy heart trembles within me. Neither Science nor the gods can help or\r\ncomfort in this awful world of Greatness!\r\n\r\n\"We stop. I hang motionless in the air. The ground beneath is utterly\r\ninsane. But I see vast uncovered veins of rare metal--and crystal,\r\nprecious crystal, enough to cover the mightiest Temple we could build!\r\nOh, that Mortia were so blessed! In all this terrifying world, the\r\nrichness of the crystal and the marvelous metal do redeem.\r\n\r\n\"Men!----I see ... I believe it is a temple! It is incredibly tall, of\r\nblack foundation and red spire, but it is weathered, leaning as if to\r\nfall--and very bare. The people cannot love their Gods as we--or else\r\nthere is the Hunger.... But the gods may enlighten this world, too, and\r\nif lowered, I will make for it. A sacred Temple should be a\r\nhaven--friends! I descend.\"\r\n\r\n_The little man's eye had caught my scissors and a glass ruler as I\r\nsuspended him above my desk. They were his exposed vein of metal and the\r\nprecious crystal. I was searching for something to secure him. In the\r\nlast second before I lowered him, his heart swelled at the sight of the\r\n\"Temple\"--my red and black pen slanting upward from the desk holder._\r\n\r\n_A stamp lying on my desk was an inspiration. I licked it, turned it gum\r\nside up, and cautiously pressed the little man against it feet first.\r\nWith the thought, \"That ought to hold him,\" I dashed upstairs to answer\r\nthe call._\r\n\r\n_But it didn't hold him. There was quite a bit of strength in that tiny\r\nbody._\r\n\r\n\"Miserable fate! I flounder in a horrid marsh,\" the upset thought-waves\r\ncame to the men of Mortia. \"The viscous mire seeks to entrap me, but I\r\nthink I can escape it. Then I will make for the Temple. The Gods may\r\nrecognize and protect me there.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI missed the call--I had delayed too long--but the momentary diversion\r\nhad cleared my mind and allowed new thoughts to enter. I now knew what\r\nmy first step would be in presenting the little man to the world.\r\n\r\nI'd write a newspaper account myself--exclusive! Give the scoop to Earl.\r\nWould that be a sensation for _his_ paper! Then I'd be made. A friend of\r\nthe family, this prominent publisher had often promised he would give me\r\na break when I was ready. Well, I _was_ ready!\r\n\r\nExcited, dashing downstairs, I half-formulated the idea. The\r\nheadlines--the little man under a microscope--a world afire to see him.\r\nFame ... pictures ... speeches ... movies ... money.... But here I was\r\nat my desk, and I grabbed for a piece of typing paper. They'd put that\r\nin a museum, too!\r\n\r\nThe stamp and the little man lay just at the edge of the sheet, and he\r\nclutched at a \"great orange mountain\" covered by a \"vast slab of\r\ncurving, opaque glass\" like the \"Temples of Aerat.\" It was my thumb, but\r\nI did not see him there.\r\n\r\n_I thrust the paper into the typewriter and twirled it through._\r\n\r\n\"I have fallen from the mountain, and hang perpendicularly, perilously,\r\non a limitless white plain. I tremble, on the verge of falling, but the\r\nslime from the marsh holds me fast.\"\r\n\r\n_I struck the first key._\r\n\r\n\"A metal meteor is roaring down upon me. Or is it something I have never\r\nbefore witnessed? It has a tail that streams off beyond sight. It comes\r\nat terrific speed.\r\n\r\n\"I know. The Gods are angry with me for leaving Mortia land. Yes! 'Tis\r\nonly They who kill by iron. Their hands clutch the rod in mighty tower\r\nBaviat, and thrust it here to stamp me out.\"\r\n\r\nAnd a shaking little figure cried: \"Baviat tertia!... Mortia mea....\" as\r\nthe Gods struck wrathfully at a small one daring to explore their\r\ndomain. For little man Jeko had contrived to see Infinity--and Infinity\r\nwas only for the eyes of the Immortals, and those of the Experience who\r\ndwelt there by the Gods' grace. He had intruded into the realm of the\r\nrulers, the world of the After Life and the Gods Omnipotent!\r\n\r\nA mortal--in the land of All!\r\n\r\nIn a world deep down in Smallness, in an electron of a cell of dead\r\nwood, five scientists were grouped before the complicated instrument so\r\nreminiscent of early radios. But now they all were standing. Strained,\r\nperspiring, frightened, they trembled, aghast at the dimensions the\r\nexperiment had assumed; they were paralysed with terror and awe as they\r\nheard of the wrath of the affronted Gods. And the spirit of science\r\nfroze within them, and would die in Mortia land. \"Seek the skies only by\r\nhallowed Death\" was what they knew. And they destroyed the machine of\r\nthe man who had found Venquil land--and thought to live--and fled as\r\nJeko's last thoughts came through.\r\n\r\nFor many years five frightened little men of an electron world would\r\nlive in deadly fear for their lives, and for their souls after death;\r\nand would pray, and become great disciples, spreading the gospels of the\r\nGods. True, Jeko had described a monstrous world; but how could a mere\r\nmortal experience its true meaning? It was really ethereal and\r\nbeautiful, was Venquil land, and they would spend the rest of their days\r\ninsuring themselves for the day of the experience--when they would\r\nassume their comforted place in the world of the After Life.\r\n\r\n_As I struck the first letter, a strange sensation swept over me.\r\nSomething compelled me to stop and look at the typing paper. I was using\r\na black ribbon, but when the key fell away, there was a tiny spot of\r\nred...._"

Once in a while she took a turn at the spit, and she\r\nnever lacked a coarse gray stocking in her lap, the foot about half\r\nfinished; it tapered away with her own waning life, and she knit the\r\ntoe-stitch on the day of her death.  She made it her serious business\r\nand sole amusement to tell me stories at any time from morning till\r\nnight, in a mumbling, toothless voice, as I sat on a log of wood,\r\ngrasping her check-apron in both my hands.  Her personal memory included\r\nthe better part of a hundred years, and she had strangely jumbled her\r\nown experience and observation with those of many old people who died in\r\nher young days; so that she might have been taken for a contemporary of\r\nQueen Elizabeth, or of John Rogers in the Primer.  There are a thousand\r\nof her traditions lurking in the corners and by-places of my mind, some\r\nmore marvellous than what is to follow, some less so, and a few not\r\nmarvellous in the least, all of which I should like to repeat, if I were\r\nas happy as she in having a listener.  But I am humble enough to own,\r\nthat I do not deserve a listener half so well as that old toothless\r\nwoman, whose narratives possessed an excellence attributable neither to\r\nherself, nor to any single individual.  Her ground-plots, seldom within\r\nthe widest scope of probability, were filled up with homely and natural\r\nincidents, the gradual accretions of a long course of years, and fiction\r\nhid its grotesque extravagance in this garb of truth, like the Devil (an\r\nappropriate simile, for the old woman supplies it) disguising himself,\r\ncloven-foot and all, in mortal attire.  These tales generally referred\r\nto her birthplace, a village in the valley of the Connecticut, the\r\naspect of which she impressed with great vividness on my fancy.  The\r\nhouses in that tract of country, long a wild and dangerous frontier,\r\nwere rendered defensible by a strength of architecture that has\r\npreserved many of them till our own times, and I cannot describe the\r\nsort of pleasure with which, two summers since, I rode through the\r\nlittle town in question, while one object after another rose familiarly\r\nto my eye, like successive portions of a dream becoming realized.  Among\r\nother things equally probable, she was wont to assert that all the\r\ninhabitants of this village (at certain intervals, but whether of\r\ntwenty-five or fifty years, or a whole century, remained a disputable\r\npoint) were subject to a simultaneous slumber, continuing one hour's\r\nspace.  When that mysterious time arrived, the parson snored over his\r\nhalf-written sermon, though it were Saturday night and no provision made\r\nfor the morrow,--the mother's eyelids closed as she bent over her\r\ninfant, and no childish cry awakened,--the watcher at the bed of mortal\r\nsickness slumbered upon the death-pillow, and the dying man anticipated\r\nhis sleep of ages by one as deep and dreamless.  To speak emphatically,\r\nthere was a soporific influence throughout the village, stronger than if\r\nevery mother's son and daughter were reading a dull story;\r\nnotwithstanding which the old woman professed to hold the substance of\r\nthe ensuing account from one of those principally concerned in it.\r\n\r\nOne moonlight summer evening, a young man and a girl sat down together\r\nin the open air.  They were distant relatives, sprung from a stock once\r\nwealthy, but of late years so poverty-stricken, that David had not a\r\npenny to pay the marriage fee, if Esther should consent to wed.  The\r\nseat they had chosen was in an open grove of elm and walnut trees, at a\r\nright angle of the road; a spring of diamond water just bubbled into the\r\nmoonlight beside them, and then whimpered away through the bushes and\r\nlong grass, in search of a neighboring millstream.  The nearest house\r\n(situate within twenty yards of them, and the residence of their\r\ngreat-grandfather in his lifetime) was a venerable old edifice, crowned\r\nwith many high and narrow peaks, all overrun by innumerable creeping\r\nplants, which hung curling about the roof like a nice young wig on an\r\nelderly gentleman's head.  Opposite to this establishment was a tavern,\r\nwith a well and horse-trough before it, and a low green bank running along\r\nthe left side of the door.  Thence, the road went onward, curving scarce\r\nperceptibly, through the village, divided in the midst by a narrow\r\nlane of verdure, and bounded on each side by a grassy strip of twice its\r\nown breadth.  The houses had generally an odd look.  Here, the moonlight\r\ntried to get a glimpse of one, a rough old heap of ponderous timber,\r\nwhich, ashamed of its dilapidated aspect, was hiding behind a great\r\nthick tree; the lower story of the next had sunk almost under ground, as\r\nif the poor little house were a-weary of the world, and retiring into\r\nthe seclusion of its own cellar; farther on stood one of the few recent\r\nstructures, thrusting its painted face conspicuously into the street,\r\nwith an evident idea that it was the fairest thing there.  About midway\r\nin the village was a grist-mill, partly concealed by the descent of the\r\nground towards the stream which turned its wheel.  At the southern\r\nextremity, just so far distant that the window-paces dazzled into each\r\nother, rose the meeting-house, a dingy old barn-like building, with an\r\nenormously disproportioned steeple sticking up straight into heaven, as\r\nhigh as the Tower of Babel, and the cause of nearly as much confusion in\r\nits day.  This steeple, it must be understood, was an afterthought, and\r\nits addition to the main edifice, when the latter had already begun to\r\ndecay, had excited a vehement quarrel, and almost a schism in the\r\nchurch, some fifty years before.  Here the road wound down a hill and\r\nwas seen no more, the remotest object in view being the graveyard gate,\r\nbeyond the meetinghouse.  The youthful pair sat hand in hand beneath the\r\ntrees, and for several moments they had not spoken, because the breeze\r\nwas hushed, the brook scarce tinkled, the leaves had ceased their\r\nrustling, and everything lay motionless and silent as if Nature were\r\ncomposing herself to slumber.\r\n\r\n\"What a beautiful night it is, Esther!\" remarked David, somewhat\r\ndrowsily.\r\n\r\n\"Very beautiful,\" answered the girl, in the same tone.\r\n\r\n\"But how still!\" continued David.\r\n\r\n\"Ah, too still!\"  said Esther, with a faint shudder, like a modest leaf\r\nwhen the wind kisses it.\r\n\r\nPerhaps they fell asleep together, and, united as their spirits were by\r\nclose and tender sympathies, the same strange dream might have wrapped\r\nthem in its shadowy arms.  But they conceived, at the time, that they\r\nstill remained wakeful by the spring of bubbling water, looking down\r\nthrough the village, and all along the moonlighted road, and at the\r\nqueer old houses, and at the trees which thrust their great twisted\r\nbranches almost into the windows.  There was only a sort of mistiness\r\nover their minds like the smoky air of an early autumn night.  At\r\nlength, without any vivid astonishment, they became conscious that a\r\ngreat many people were either entering the village or already in the\r\nstreet, but whether they came from the meeting-house, or from a little\r\nbeyond it, or where the devil they came from, was more than could be\r\ndetermined.  Certainly, a crowd of people seemed to be there, men,\r\nwomen, and children, all of whom were yawning and rubbing their eyes,\r\nstretching their limbs, and staggering from side to side of the road, as\r\nif but partially awakened from a sound slumber.  Sometimes they stood\r\nstock-still, with their hands over their brows to shade their sight from\r\nthe moonbeams.  As they drew near, most of their countenances appeared\r\nfamiliar to Esther and David, possessing the peculiar features of\r\nfamilies in the village, and that general air and aspect by which a\r\nperson would recognize his own townsmen in the remotest ends of the\r\nearth.  But though the whole multitude might have been taken, in the\r\nmass, for neighbors and acquaintances, there was not a single individual\r\nwhose exact likeness they had ever before seen.  It was a noticeable\r\ncircumstance, also, that the newest fashioned garment on the backs of\r\nthese people might have been worn by the great-grandparents of the\r\nexisting generation.  There was one figure behind all the rest, and not\r\nyet near enough to be perfectly distinguished.\r\n\r\n\"Where on earth, David, do all these odd people come from?\" said Esther,\r\nwith a lazy inclination to laugh.\r\n\r\n\"Nowhere on earth, Esther,\" replied David, unknowing why he said so.\r\n\r\nAs they spoke, the strangers showed some symptoms of disquietude, and\r\nlooked towards the fountain for an instant, but immediately appeared to\r\nassume their own trains of thought and previous purposes.  They now\r\nseparated to different parts of the village, with a readiness that\r\nimplied intimate local knowledge, and it may be worthy of remark, that,\r\nthough they were evidently loquacious among themselves, neither their\r\nfootsteps nor their voices reached the ears of the beholders.  Wherever\r\nthere was a venerable old house, of fifty years' standing and upwards,\r\nsurrounded by its elm or walnut trees, with its dark and weather-beaten\r\nbarn, its well, its orchard and stone-walls, all ancient and all in good\r\nrepair around it, there a little group of these people assembled.  Such\r\nparties were mostly composed of an aged man and woman, with the younger\r\nmembers of a family; their faces were full of joy, so deep that it\r\nassumed the shade of melancholy; they pointed to each other the minutest\r\nobjects about the homesteads, things in their hearts, and were now\r\ncomparing them with the originals.  But where hollow places by the\r\nwayside, grass-grown and uneven, with unsightly chimneys rising ruinous\r\nin the midst, gave indications of a fallen dwelling and of hearths long\r\ncold, there did a few of the strangers sit them down on the mouldering\r\nbeams, and on the yellow moss that had overspread the door-stone.  The\r\nmen folded their arms, sad and speechless; the women wrung their hands\r\nwith a more vivid expression of grief; and the little children tottered\r\nto their knees, shrinking away from the open grave of domestic love.\r\nAnd wherever a recent edifice reared its white and flashy front on the\r\nfoundation of an old one, there a gray-haired man might be seen to shake\r\nhis staff in anger at it, while his aged dame and their offspring\r\nappeared to join in their maledictions, forming a fearful picture in the\r\nghostly moon light.  While these scenes were passing, the one figure in\r\nthe rear of all the rest was descending the hollow towards the mill, and\r\nthe eyes of David and Esther were drawn thence to a pair with whom they\r\ncould fully sympathize.  It was a youth in a sailor's dress and a pale\r\nslender maiden, who met each other with a sweet embrace in the middle of\r\nthe street.\r\n\r\n\"How long it must be since they parted,\" observed David.\r\n\r\n\"Fifty years at least,\" said Esther.\r\n\r\nThey continued to gaze with unwondering calmness and quiet interest, as\r\nthe dream (if such it were) unrolled its quaint and motley semblance\r\nbefore them, and their notice was now attracted by several little knots\r\nof people apparently engaged in conversation.  Of these one of the\r\nearliest collected and most characteristic was near the tavern, the\r\npersons who composed it being seated on the low green bank along the\r\nleft side of the door.  A conspicuous figure here was a fine corpulent\r\nold fellow in his shirt-sleeves and flame-colored breeches, and with a\r\nstained white apron over his paunch, beneath which he held his hands and\r\nwherewith at times be wiped his ruddy face.  The stately decrepitude of\r\none of his companions, the scar of an Indian tomahawk on his crown, and\r\nespecially his worn buff coat, were appropriate marks of a veteran\r\nbelonging to an old Provincial garrison, now deaf to the roll-call.\r\nAnother showed his rough face under a tarry hat and wore a pair of wide\r\ntrousers, like an ancient mariner who bad tossed away his youth upon the\r\nsea, and was returned, hoary and weather-beaten, to his inland home.\r\nThere was also a thin young man, carelessly dressed, who ever and anon\r\ncast a sad look towards the pale maiden above mentioned.  With these\r\nthere sat a hunter, and one or two others, and they were soon joined by\r\na miller, who came upward from the dusty mill, his coat as white as if\r\nbesprinkled with powdered starlight.  All these (by the aid of jests,\r\nwhich might indeed be old, but had not been recently repeated) waxed\r\nvery merry, and it was rather strange, that just as their sides shook\r\nwith the heartiest laughter, they appeared greatly like a group of\r\nshadows flickering in the moonshine.  Four personages, very different\r\nfrom these, stood in front of the large house with its periwig of\r\ncreeping plants.  One was a little elderly figure, distinguished by the\r\ngold on his three-cornered bat and sky-blue coat, and by the seal of\r\narms annexed to his great gold watch-chain; his air and aspect befitted\r\na Justice of Peace and County Major, and all earth's pride and pomposity\r\nwere squeezed into this small gentleman of five feet high.  The next in\r\nimportance was a grave person of sixty or seventy years, whose black\r\nsuit and hand sufficiently indicated his character, and the polished\r\nbaldness of whose head was worthy of a famous preacher in the village,\r\nhalf a century before, who had made wigs a subject of pulpit\r\ndenunciation.  The two other figures, both clad in dark gray, showed the\r\nsobriety of Deacons; one was ridiculously tall and thin, like a man of\r\nordinary bulk infinitely produced, as the mathematicians say; while the\r\nbrevity and thickness of his colleague seemed a compression of the same\r\nman.  These four talked with great earnestness, and their gestures\r\nintimated that they had revived the ancient dispute about the meeting-house\r\nsteeple.  The grave person in black spoke with composed solemnity,\r\nas if he were addressing a Synod; the short deacon grunted out\r\noccasional sentences, as brief as himself; his tall brother drew the\r\nlong thread of his argument through the whole discussion, and (reasoning\r\nfrom analogy) his voice must indubitably have been small and squeaking.\r\nBut the little old man in gold-lace was evidently scorched by his own\r\nred-hot eloquence; he bounced from one to another, shook his cane at the\r\nsteeple, at the two deacons, and almost in the parson's face, stamping\r\nwith his foot fiercely enough to break a hole through the very earth;\r\nthough, indeed, it could not exactly be said that the green grass bent\r\nbeneath him.  The figure, noticed as coming behind all the rest, had now\r\nsurmounted the ascent from the mill, and proved to be an elderly lady\r\nwith something in her hand.\r\n\r\n\"Why does she walk so slow?\" asked David.\r\n\r\n\"Don't you see she is lame?\" said Esther.\r\n\r\nThis gentlewoman, whose infirmity had kept her so far in the rear of the\r\ncrowd, now came hobbling on, glided unobserved by the polemic group, and\r\npaused on the left brink of the fountain, within a few feet of the two\r\nspectators.  She was a magnificent old dame, as ever mortal eye beheld.\r\nHer spangled shoes and gold-clocked stockings shone gloriously within the\r\nspacious circle of a red hoop-petticoat, which swelled to the very point\r\nof explosion, and was bedecked all over with embroidery a little\r\ntarnished.  Above the petticoat, and parting in front so as to display\r\nit to the best advantage, was a figured blue damask gown.  A wide and\r\nstiff ruff encircled her neck, a cap of the finest muslin, though rather\r\ndingy, covered her head; and her nose was bestridden by a pair of\r\ngold-bowed spectacles with enormous glasses.  But the old lady's face was\r\npinched, sharp and sallow, wearing a niggardly and avaricious\r\nexpression, and forming an odd contrast to the splendor of her attire,\r\nas did likewise the implement which she held in her hand.  It was a sort\r\nof iron shovel (by housewives termed a \"slice\"), such as is used in\r\nclearing the oven, and with this, selecting a spot between a walnut-tree\r\nand the fountain, the good dame made an earnest attempt to dig.  The\r\ntender sods, however, possessed a strange impenetrability.  They\r\nresisted her efforts like a quarry of living granite, and losing her\r\nbreath, she cast down the shovel and seemed to bemoan herself most\r\npiteously, gnashing her teeth (what few she had) and wringing her thin\r\nyellow hands.  Then, apparently with new hope, she resumed her toil,\r\nwhich still had the same result,--a circumstance the less surprising to\r\nDavid and Esther, because at times they would catch the moonlight\r\nshining through the old woman, and dancing in the fountain beyond.  The\r\nlittle man in goldlace now happened to see her, and made his approach on\r\ntiptoe.\r\n\r\n\"How hard this elderly lady works!\" remarked David.\r\n\r\n\"Go and help her, David,\" said Esther, compassionately.\r\n\r\nAs their drowsy void spoke, both the old woman and the pompous little\r\nfigure behind her lifted their eyes, and for a moment they regarded the\r\nyouth and damsel with something like kindness and affection; which,\r\nhowever, were dim and uncertain, and passed away almost immediately.\r\nThe old woman again betook herself to the shovel, but was startled by a\r\nhand suddenly laid upon her shoulder; she turned round in great\r\ntrepidation, and beheld the dignitary in the blue coat; then followed an\r\nembrace of such closeness as would indicate no remoter connection than\r\nmatrimony between these two decorous persons.  The gentleman next\r\npointed to the shovel, appearing to inquire the purpose of his lady's\r\noccupation; while she as evidently parried his interrogatories,\r\nmaintaining a demure and sanctified visage as every good woman ought, in\r\nsimilar cases.  Howbeit, she could not forbear looking askew, behind her\r\nspectacles, towards the spot of stubborn turf.  All the while, their\r\nfigures had a strangeness in them, and it seemed as if some cunning\r\njeweller had made their golden ornaments of the yellowest of the setting\r\nsunbeams, and that the blue of their garments was brought from the dark\r\nsky near the moon, and that the gentleman's silk waistcoat was the\r\nbright side of a fiery cloud, and the lady's scarlet petticoat a remnant\r\nof the blush of morning,--and that they both were two unrealities of\r\ncolored air.  But now there was a sudden movement throughout the\r\nmultitude.  The Squire drew forth a watch as large as the dial on the\r\nfamous steeple, looked at the warning hands and got him gone, nor could\r\nhis lady tarry; the party at the tavern door took to their heels, headed\r\nby the fat man in the flaming breeches; the tall deacon stalked away\r\nimmediately, and the short deacon waddled after, making four steps to\r\nthe yard; the mothers called their children about them and set forth,\r\nwith a gentle and sad glance behind.  Like cloudy fantasies that hurry\r\nby a viewless impulse from the sky, they all were fled, and the wind\r\nrose up and followed them with a strange moaning down the lonely street.\r\nNow whither these people went, is more than may be told; only David and\r\nEsther seemed to see the shadowy splendor of the ancient dame, as she\r\nlingered in the moonshine at the graveyard gate, gazing backward to the\r\nfountain.\r\n\r\n\"O Esther!  I have had such a dream!\" cried David, starting up, and\r\nrubbing his eyes.\r\n\r\n\"And I such another!\" answered Esther, gaping till her pretty red lips\r\nformed a circle.\r\n\r\n\"About an old woman with gold-bowed spectacles,\" continued David.\r\n\r\n\"And a scarlet hoop-petticoat,\" added Esther.  They now stared in each\r\nother's eyes, with great astonishment and some little fear.  After a\r\nthoughtful moment or two, David drew a long breath and stood upright.\r\n\r\n\"If I live till to-morrow morning,\" said he, \"I'll see what may be\r\nburied between that tree and the spring of water.\"\r\n\r\n\"And why not to-night, David?\" asked Esther; for she was a sensible\r\nlittle girl, and bethought herself that the matter might as well be done\r\nin secrecy.\r\n\r\nDavid felt the propriety of the remark and looked round for the means of\r\nfollowing her advice.  The moon shone brightly on something that rested\r\nagainst the side of the old house, and, on a nearer view, it proved to\r\nbe an iron shovel, bearing a singular resemblance to that which they had\r\nseen in their dreams.  He used it with better success than the old\r\nwoman, the soil giving way so freely to his efforts, that he had soon\r\nscooped a hole as large as the basin of the spring.  Suddenly, he poked\r\nhis head down to the very bottom of this cavity.  \"Oho!--what have we\r\nhere?\" cried David.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's An Old Woman's Tale, by Nathaniel Hawthorne"

And an even bigger question:\r\n           should they investigate--or run for their lives!\r\n\r\n           [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\r\n              Imagination Stories of Science and Fantasy\r\n                               May 1952\r\n         Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\r\n         the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\r\n\r\n\r\nWe will not consider the odds involved in their finding the stranger,\r\nfor the odds were impossible.\r\n\r\nThey came down to rest their tubes on an unnamed planet of a\r\nlittle-known star in the Buckhorn Cluster. Because they were tired from\r\nweeks in space, they came in without looking. They circled the planet\r\nonce and spiraled down to an open patch of sand between two rocky\r\ncliffs. Only then did they see the other ship.\r\n\r\nJeff Wadley was at the controls and his eyes widened when he saw it.\r\nBut his fingers did not hesitate on the controls, for a deep-space\r\nstarship is not the kind of vehicle that can change its mind about\r\nlanding once it is within half a mile of the ground. He brought the\r\nEmerald Girl in smoothly to a stop not five hundred feet from the\r\nstranger. Then he sat back.\r\n\r\n\"Dad,\" he said flatly, into the intercom, \"swing the turret!\"\r\n\r\nPeter Wadley, up in the instrument room, had already seen the strange\r\nship, and the heavy twin barrels of the automatic rifles were\r\ndepressing to cover. Jeff leaned forward to the communicator.\r\n\r\n\"_Identify yourself!_\" The tight beam in Common Code snapped across\r\nthe little stretch of open sand to the cliff against which the other\r\nseemed to nestle. \"We are the mining ship Emerald Girl, Earth license,\r\nfive hundred and eighty-two days out of Arcturus Station. _Identify\r\nyourself!_\"\r\n\r\nThere were steps behind Jeff, and Peter Wadley came to stand behind his\r\nson's tense back.\r\n\r\n\"Do they answer, Jeff?\"\r\n\r\n\"No.\"\r\n\r\n\"_Identify yourself. Identify yourself! Identify yourself!_\"\r\n\r\nThe angry demand crackled and arced invisibly across the space between\r\nboth vessels. And there was no answer.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nJeff sat back from the communicator. The palms of his hands were wet\r\nand he wiped them on the cloth of his breeches.\r\n\r\n\"Let's get out of here,\" he said nervously.\r\n\r\n\"And leave _him_?\" his father's lean forefinger indicated the strange\r\nsilent ship.\r\n\r\n\"Why not?\" Jeff jerked his face up. \"We're no salvage outfit or\r\nGovernment exploration unit.\"\r\n\r\nThere was a moment of tenseness between them. The older man's face\r\ntightened.\r\n\r\n\"We'd better look into it,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"Are you crazy?\" blazed Jeff. \"It was here when we came. It'll be here\r\nif we leave. Let's get going. We can report it if you want. Let the\r\nFederal ships investigate.\"\r\n\r\n\"Maybe it just landed,\" his father said evenly. \"Maybe it's in trouble.\"\r\n\r\n\"What if it is?\" Jeff insisted. \"Don't you realize we're a sitting\r\ntarget here? And what do you think it is--Aunt Susie's runabout? Look\r\nat it!\" And with a savage flip of his hand he shoved the magnification\r\nof the viewing screen up so that the other ship seemed to loom up a\r\nhandbreadth beyond their walls.\r\n\r\nIt was an unnecessary gesture. There was no mistaking that the lines\r\nof the other ship were foreign to any they had ever seen. It was big:\r\nnot outlandishly big, but bigger than the Emerald Girl, and bulb-shaped\r\nwith most of its bulk in front. There was no sign of ports or\r\nairlocks, only a few stubby fins, which projected forlornly from the\r\nbody at an angle of some thirty degrees.\r\n\r\nAnd from its silence and immobility, its strange inhuman lines, a cold\r\nair of alien menace seemed to reach out to chill the two watching men.\r\n\r\n\"Well?\" challenged Jeff. But the older man was not listening.\r\n\r\n\"The radarcamera,\" he said, half to himself. He turned on his heel and\r\nstalked off. Jeff, sitting tensely in his chair, heard his father's\r\nfootsteps die away, to be succeeded seconds later by the distant clumsy\r\nsounds of a man getting into a spacesuit. Jeff swore, and jumping to\r\nhis feet, ran to the airlock. His father, radarcamera at his feet, was\r\nalready half-dressed to go outside.\r\n\r\n\"You aren't going out there?\" he asked incredulously.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe older man nodded and picked up his fishbowl helmet. Jeff's face\r\ntwisted in dismay.\r\n\r\n\"I won't let you!\" he half-shouted. \"You're risking your life and I\r\ncan't navigate the ship without you.\"\r\n\r\nHelmet in hand, his father paused, the deep-graved lines of his face\r\nstiffening.\r\n\r\n\"I'm still master of this ship!\" he said curtly. \"Alien or not that\r\nother ship may need assistance. By intraspace law I'm obliged to give\r\nit. If you're worried, cover me from the gun-turret.\" He dropped the\r\nhelmet over his head, cutting Jeff off from further protest.\r\n\r\nSeething with mixed fear and anger, Jeff turned abruptly and climbed\r\nhurriedly to the gun-turret. The twin barrels of the rifles were\r\nalready centered on their target, which the aiming screen showed,\r\ntogether with the area between the two vessels and a portion of the\r\nEmerald Girl's airlock, which projected from her side. As Jeff watched,\r\nthe outer lock swung open and a grey, space-suited figure raced for\r\nthe protection of the bow. It was a dash of no more than five seconds'\r\nduration, but to Jeff it seemed that his father took an eternity to\r\nreach safety.\r\n\r\nHe reached for the microphone on the ship's circuit and pulled it to\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n\"All right, Dad?\" In spite of himself, Jeff's voice was still ragged\r\nwith anger.\r\n\r\n\"Fine, Jeff,\" his father's voice came back in unperturbed tones. \"I'm\r\nwell shielded and I can get good, clean shots at every part of her.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let me know when you're ready to start back,\" said Jeff, and shoved\r\nthe microphone away from him.\r\n\r\nHe sat back and lit a cigarette, but his eyes continued to watch the\r\nother ship as a man might watch a dud bomb which has not yet been\r\ndisarmed. After a while, he noticed his fingers were shaking, and he\r\nlaid the cigarette carefully down in the ashtray.\r\n\r\nWhen he comes back, thought Jeff, it'll be time. We'll have this thing\r\nout then. He's become some sort of a religious fanatic, and he doesn't\r\nknow it. How a man who's been all over hell and seen the worst sides\r\nof fifty different races in as many years can think of them all as\r\nlovable human children, I don't know. But, know it or not, this taking\r\nof chances has got to stop someplace; and right here is the best place\r\nof all. When he gets back--if he gets back, we're taking off. And if he\r\ndoesn't get back ... I'll blow that bloody bastard over there into so\r\nmany bits....\r\n\r\n\"Coming in, Jeff,\" his father's voice on the speaker interrupted him.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nJeff leaned forward, his hands on the trips of the rifles; the small\r\ngrey figure suddenly shot back to the protection of the airlock,\r\nwhich snapped shut behind it. Then, he took a deep breath, stood up,\r\nand wiped the perspiration from his forehead. He went down to the\r\ninstrument room.\r\n\r\nPeter Wadley was already out of his suit and developing the pictures.\r\nJeff picked them up as they came off the roll, damp and soft to the\r\ntouch.\r\n\r\n\"I can't tell much,\" he said, holding them up to the light.\r\n\r\n\"There's a great deal of overlap,\" his father answered. \"We're going\r\nto have to section and fit the pieces together like a jigsaw puzzle.\r\nWait'll I'm through here.\"\r\n\r\nFor about five minutes more, pictures continued to come off the roll.\r\nThen Peter picked up a pair of scissors and arranged the prints in\r\ntheir proper sequence.\r\n\r\n\"Clear the table,\" he told Jeff, \"and fit these together as I hand them\r\nto you.\"\r\n\r\nFor a little while longer, they worked in silence. Then Peter laid down\r\nhis scissors.\r\n\r\n\"That's all,\" he said. \"Now, what have we got?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know,\" answered Jeff, bewilderment in his voice. \"It looks\r\nlike nothing I've ever seen.\"\r\n\r\nPeter stepped up to the table and squinted at the shadowy films with\r\neyes practiced in reading rock formations. He shook his head.\r\n\r\n\"It is strange,\" he said, finally.\r\n\r\n\"Do you see what I see?\" demanded Jeff. \"There's no real crew\r\nspace. There's this one spot--up front--\" he indicated it with his\r\nfinger--\"that's about as big as a good sized closet. And nothing more\r\nthan that--except corridors about twenty inches in diameter running\r\nfrom it to points all over the ship. She must be flown by a crew of\r\nmidgets.\"\r\n\r\n\"Midgets,\" echoed the older man, thoughtfully. \"I never heard of an\r\nintelligent race that small.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then they're something new,\" said Jeff, with a shrug of his shoulders.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" said his father, slowly. \"I don't remember when or where I heard\r\nit, but there's some reason why you couldn't have an intelligent race\r\nmuch smaller than a good sized dog. It has something to do with the\r\nfact that they grow in size as their developing intelligence gives them\r\nan increasing advantage over their environment.\"\r\n\r\n\"Here's the evidence,\" Jeff answered, tapping the film with one finger.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" Pete was bending over the picture fragments again. \"Look at these\r\nthings in the corridor. They're obviously controls.\"\r\n\r\nJeff looked.\r\n\r\n\"I see what you mean,\" he said at last. \"If there's any similarity\r\nbetween their mechanical system and ours, these controls are built for\r\nsomebody pretty big. But look how they're scattered all over the ship.\r\nThere's a good fifteen or twenty different groups of instruments and\r\nother things. That means a number of crew members; and you simply can't\r\nput a number of large crew members in those little corridors.\"\r\n\r\n\"There's a large amount of total space,\" Pete began. Then, suddenly a\r\nfaint tremor ran through the ship. Jeff leaped for the screen and his\r\nfather moved over to stand behind him.\r\n\r\n\"Good Lord,\" said Jeff, \"look at her.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe other ship shook suddenly and rolled slightly to one side. Some\r\nunseen center of gravity pulled her back to her original position. She\r\nhesitated a moment, and then tried again, with the same results. She\r\nlay quiescent.\r\n\r\nJeff pounced on his radiation drum graph.\r\n\r\n\"What does it say?\" Peter asked.\r\n\r\nJeff shook his head in astonishment. \"Nothing,\" he answered, \"just\r\nnothing at all.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nothing?\" Peter came over to take a look at the graph himself. It was\r\nas Jeff had said. The line tracing the white surface of the graph was\r\nstraight and undisturbed.\r\n\r\n\"But that's impossible,\" Peter frowned.\r\n\r\nThe two men turned back to the screen. As they watched, one final\r\nshudder shook the strange ship, and then, like a stranded whale who has\r\ngiven up hope, it lay still.\r\n\r\n\"My God!\" said Pete, and Jeff turned to him in astonishment. It was the\r\nclosest to profanity his father had come in twenty years. \"Jeff, do you\r\nknow what I think? I think that ship is manned by just one great big\r\ncreature--like a giant squid. That's why no radiation registered. He\r\nwas trying to move his ship by sheer strength.\"\r\n\r\nJeff stared at his father.\r\n\r\n\"You're crazy,\" was all he could manage to say. \"Why, something big\r\nenough to shake that ship would have to fill every inch of space inside\r\nit. You can't live in a space ship that way.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's right,\" Pete answered. He clamped his hand on Jeff's shoulder\r\nexcitedly and led him back to the jigsaw puzzle on the table.\r\n\r\n\"If I'm right,\" he said, \"that's no ship at all as we understand it,\r\nbut some sort of a space-going suit for something terrifically large.\r\nSomething like a giant squid, as I said, or some other long-tentacled\r\ncreature. His body would lie here--in this space you said was about the\r\nsize of a closet--and his tentacles or whatever they are, would reach\r\nout in these corridors to the various groups of instruments.\"\r\n\r\nJeff frowned.\r\n\r\n\"It sounds sensible,\" he muttered. \"And in any case, he wouldn't be\r\nable to get outside his ship to fix anything that went wrong. And I\r\ntake it there is something wrong, or else he wouldn't be jumping around\r\ninside.\"\r\n\r\n\"Jeff,\" Pete said, \"I'm going outside to take a close look at him.\"\r\n\r\nJeff's head snapped up from the jigsaw puzzle. The old, sick fear had\r\ncome back. It washed over him like a wave.\r\n\r\n\"Why?\" he demanded harshly.\r\n\r\n\"To see if I can find out what's wrong with his ship,\" said Pete over\r\nhis shoulder as he went to the airlock. \"Coming?\"\r\n\r\n\"Wait!\" cried Jeff. He stood up and followed his father. For a moment\r\nthere, they stood facing each other, two tall men with less apparent\r\nphysical difference between them than their ages might indicate, poised\r\non the brink of an open break.\r\n\r\n\"Wait,\" said Jeff again, and now his voice was lower, more under\r\ncontrol. \"Dad, there's no point in playing around any longer. You\r\naren't going to be satisfied just to look around out there and then\r\nleave. You're going to do something. And if that's it I want to know\r\nnow.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThere was a moment's silence; then Pete turned back to Jeff, his face\r\nset.\r\n\r\n\"That's right,\" he said. \"I don't have to look. I know what's wrong.\r\nAnd I know what I'm going to do about it. There's a living intelligence\r\ntrapped in that space-thing as you and I might be trapped. I can set it\r\nfree with two of our motor jacks. If you've got one inkling of what it\r\nmeans to be ignored when you're caught like that, you'll help me. If\r\nnot, I'm taking two jacks out the airlock and you can fire the motors\r\nand take off and be damned to you.\"\r\n\r\nBetween the two big men the tension built and strained and broke. Jeff\r\nlet out a ragged sigh.\r\n\r\n\"All right,\" he said. \"I'm with you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good,\" said the older man, and there was new life in his voice. \"Get\r\nyour suit on. I'll explain as we dress.\"\r\n\r\n\"The trouble with our friend there is that he's fallen over. I see you\r\ndon't understand, Jeff. Well, this ship of ours lands on her belly.\r\nWe've got booster rockets all over the hull to correct our landing\r\nangle. But ships weren't always that way. They used to have to sit\r\ndown on their tail. There's no furrow where that ship landed, only a\r\ncircular blasted spot, so it figures. Maybe some of his mechanism went\r\nwrong at the last minute.\r\n\r\n\"At any rate, I'm betting that if we get him upright again, he can take\r\ncare of himself from there on out. So you and I are going to go out\r\nthere with a couple of jacks and see if we can't jack him back up into\r\nposition.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe sand was thick and heavy. The walk over to the other ship was\r\ntedious, with the heavy jacks weighing them down. They reached the\r\nalien hull, paused a moment to get their breath and then attached the\r\nmagnetic grapples to the skin of the ship at two points on opposite\r\nsides of the hull and roughly a fourth of the way up from the rocket\r\ntubes.\r\n\r\nIt was hard to anchor the jacks in the soft sand. They finally found\r\nit necessary to dig them in some three or four feet to a layer of rock\r\nthat underlay the sand. Then, when everything was ready, they took\r\ntheir stations, each at a jack, and Pete called to Jeff on the helmet\r\nset.\r\n\r\n\"All ready? Start your motor.\"\r\n\r\nJeff reached down and flicked a switch. The tiny, powerful jack motor\r\nbegan to spin, and the jack base settled more solidly against its rocky\r\nbed. When he was sure that it would not slip, he left it, and went\r\naround the rockets to stand by his father.\r\n\r\nHis face was grey.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said Pete tensely, \"up she goes.\"\r\n\r\nThe nose of the alien ship was raising slowly from the sand. It\r\nquivered softly from some motion inside the ship.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said Jeff, \"up she goes.\" His words were flat and dull. Pete\r\nturned to look at him.\r\n\r\n\"Scared, son?\" he asked. Jeff's lips parted, closed and opened again.\r\n\r\n\"You know how we stand,\" he said, dully. \"I've heard what you said from\r\nother men, but never from an alien. Most of the ones we know hit first,\r\nand talk afterward. You know that once this ship is on its feet we're\r\nat his mercy. Just his rocket blasts alone could kill us; and there\r\nwon't be time to get back to the Girl.\"\r\n\r\nThe alien was now at an angle of forty-five degrees. The little jacks\r\nstretched steadily, pushing their thin, stiff arms against the strange\r\nhull. Sand dripped from the rising ship.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Jeff,\" Pete said. \"I know. But the important thing isn't what he\r\ndoes, but what we do. The fact that we've helped him--can't you see it\r\nthat way, son?\"\r\n\r\nJeff shook his head in bewilderment.\r\n\r\n\"I don't know,\" he said helplessly. \"I just don't know.\"\r\n\r\nThe ship was now nearly upright. Suddenly, with an abruptness that\r\nstartled both men, it shook itself free of the jacks and teetered free\r\nfor a second, before coming to rest, its nose pointing straight up.\r\n\r\n\"Here it goes,\" said Pete, a tinge of excitement in his voice. They\r\nmoved back some yards to be out of the way of the takeoff blast.\r\nSuddenly the ground trembled under their feet. Pete put his hand on the\r\nyounger man's shoulder.\r\n\r\n\"Here it goes,\" he repeated, in a whisper.\r\n\r\nFlame burst abruptly from the base of the ship. It was warming up its\r\ntubes. Slowly the flame puffed out from its base and it began to rise.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nJeff shook suddenly with an uncontrollable shudder. His voice came to\r\nPete through the earphones, starkly afraid.\r\n\r\n\"Now what?\" he cried. \"What'll he do now?\"\r\n\r\nPete's grip tightened on his shoulder.\r\n\r\n\"Steady boy.\"\r\n\r\nThe ship was rising. Up it went, and up, until it was the size of a\r\nman's little finger, a tiny sliver of silver against the black backdrop\r\nof the sky. Then, inexplicably, it halted and began to reverse itself.\r\n\r\nSlowly it turned, until the blunt nose pointed toward them. Jeff's\r\nhoarse breathing was loud in his helmet. _Now it comes_, he thought,\r\nand his muscles tensed.\r\n\r\nA long minute flowed by and still the alien hung there. Then, abruptly\r\nit went into a series of idiotic gyrations; it twisted and turned, and\r\nspun around, swinging its fiery trail of rocket gases like a luminous\r\ntail in the darkness. Then, just as abruptly, it reversed once more,\r\nso that its head was away from them; in the twinkling of a moment it\r\nwas gone.\r\n\r\nPete sighed, a deep, ragged sigh.\r\n\r\n\"Did you see it, boy?\" he cried. \"Did you see it?\"\r\n\r\n\"I saw,\" Jeff's voice was filled with a new awe. \"Now I get it. He\r\nwasn't sure--he didn't know we were really trying to help him until we\r\nlet him get all the way out there by himself. Then he knew he was free.\r\nThat's why he wouldn't answer before.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sure, Jeff, sure,\" said the older man, a note of triumph in his voice.\r\n\"But that's not what I mean. Did you notice all those contortions he\r\nwas going through up there? What did they remind you of?\"\r\n\r\nThere was a moment of silence, then the words came, at first slowly,\r\nthen in a rush from Jeff's lips.\r\n\r\n\"Like a puppy,\" he said, haltingly, stumbling over the wonder of it.\r\n\"Like a puppy wagging its tail.\"\r\n\r\nAnd the light of a new understanding broke suddenly in his eyes.\r\n\r\n\"Dad!\" said Jeff, turning to his father. \"Dad! Do you know what I\r\nthink? I think we've made a friend.\"\r\n\r\nAnd the two men stood there, side by side, looking into the blackness\r\nof space where an odd-shaped spacecraft had vanished. It, they felt,\r\nwas on its way home.\r\n\r\nAnd they were right. Moreover, It was hurrying.\r\n\r\nFor It had a story to tell."

It dived, like a piece of black slate, but opened soon,\r\ndisclosing leaves of pale green, which quivered into blue. Now it had\r\nvanished, now it was a piece of magical india rubber stretching out\r\nto infinity, now it was a book again, but bigger than the book of all\r\nknowledge. It grew more fantastic as it reached the bottom, where a\r\npuff of sand welcomed it and obscured it from view. But it reappeared,\r\nquite sane though a little tremulous, lying decently open on its back,\r\nwhile unseen fingers fidgeted among its leaves.\r\n\r\n\"It is such a pity\" said my aunt, \"that you will not finish your work\r\nin the Hotel. Then you would be free to enjoy yourself and this would\r\nnever have happened.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nothing of it but will change into something rich and strange,\"\r\nwarbled the chaplain, while his sister said \"Why it's gone into the\r\nwater.\" As for the boatmen, one of them laughed, while the other,\r\nwithout a word of warning, stood up and began to take his clothes off.\r\n\r\n\"Holy Moses!\" cried the Colonel. \"Is the fellow mad?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, thank him dear,\" said my aunt: \"that is to say tell him he is\r\nvery kind, but perhaps another time.\"\r\n\r\n\"All the same I do want my book back,\" I complained. \"It's for my\r\nFellowship Dissertation. There won't be much left of it by another\r\ntime.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have an idea,\" said some woman or other through her parasol. \"Let\r\nus leave this child of nature to dive for the book while we go on to\r\nthe other grotto. We can land him either on this rock or on the ledge\r\ninside, and he will be ready when we return.\"\r\n\r\nThe idea seemed good; and I improved it by saying I would be left\r\nbehind too, to lighten the boat. So the two of us were deposited\r\noutside the little grotto on a great sunlit rock that guarded the\r\nharmonies within. Let us call them blue, though they suggest rather the\r\nspirit of what is clean, cleanliness passed from the domestic to the\r\nsublime, the cleanliness of all the sea gathered together and radiating\r\nlight. The Blue Grotto at Capri contains only more blue water, not\r\nbluer water. That colour and that spirit is the heritage of every cave\r\nin the Mediterranean into which the sun can shine and the sea flow.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the boat left I realised how imprudent I had been to trust\r\nmyself on a sloping rock with an unknown Sicilian. With a jerk he\r\nbecame alive, seizing my arm and saying \"Go to the end of the Grotto\r\nand I will show you something beautiful.\"\r\n\r\nHe made me jump off the rock on to the ledge over a dazzling crack of\r\nsea, he drew me away from the light till I was standing on the tiny\r\nbeach of sand which emerged like powdered turquoise at the further end.\r\nThere he left me with his clothes, and returned swiftly to the summit\r\nof the entrance-rock. For a moment he stood naked in the brilliant sun,\r\nlooking down at the spot where the book lay. Then he crossed himself,\r\nraised his hands above his head, and dived.\r\n\r\nIf the book was wonderful, the man is past all description. His effect\r\nwas that of a silver statue, alive beneath the sea, through whom life\r\nthrobbed in blue and green. Something infinitely happy, infinitely\r\nwise--but it was impossible that it should emerge from the depths\r\nsunburnt and dripping, holding the note book on the Deist Controversy\r\nbetween its teeth.\r\n\r\nA gratuity is generally expected by those who bathe. Whatever I\r\noffered, he was sure to want more, and I was disinclined for an\r\nargument in a place so beautiful and also so solitary. It was a relief\r\nthat he should say in conversational tones \"In a place like this one\r\nmight see the Siren.\"\r\n\r\nI was delighted with him for thus falling into the key of his\r\nsurroundings. We had been left together in a magic world, apart from\r\nall the commonplaces that are called reality, a world of blue whose\r\nfloor was the sea and whose walls and roof of rock trembled with the\r\nsea's reflections. Here, only the fantastic would be tolerable, and it\r\nwas in that spirit that I echoed his words. \"One might easily see the\r\nSiren.\"\r\n\r\nHe watched me curiously while he dressed. I was parting the sticky\r\nleaves of the note book as I sat on the strip of sand.\r\n\r\n\"Ah!\" he said at last. \"You may have read the little book that was\r\nprinted last year. Who would have thought that our Siren would have\r\ngiven the foreigners pleasure!\"\r\n\r\n(I read it afterwards. Its account is, not unnaturally, incomplete, in\r\nspite of there being a woodcut of the young person, and the words of\r\nher song.)\r\n\r\n\"She comes out of this blue water, doesn't she,\" I suggested \"and sits\r\non the rock at the entrance, combing her hair.\"\r\n\r\nI wanted to draw him out, for I was interested in his sudden gravity,\r\nand there was a suggestion of irony in his last remark that puzzled me.\r\n\r\n\"Have you ever seen her?\"\r\n\r\n\"Often and often.\"\r\n\r\n\"I never.\"\r\n\r\n\"But you have heard her sing!\"\r\n\r\nHe put on his coat and said impatiently, \"How can she sing under the\r\nwater? Who could? She sometimes tries, but nothing comes from her but\r\ngreat bubbles.\"\r\n\r\n\"She should climb on to the rock then.\"\r\n\r\n\"How can she?\" he cried again, quite angry. \"The priests have blessed\r\nthe air, so she cannot breathe it, and blessed the rocks, so that she\r\ncannot sit on them. But the sea no man can bless, because it is too\r\nbig, and always changing. Therefore she lives in the sea.\"\r\n\r\nI was silent.\r\n\r\nAt this his face took a gentler expression. He looked at me as though\r\nsomething was on his mind, and going out to the entrance rock, gazed at\r\nthe external blue. Then returning into our twilight he said \"As a rule\r\nonly good people see the Siren.\"\r\n\r\nI made no comment. There was a pause, and he continued. \"That is a very\r\nstrange thing, and the priests do not know how to account for it; for\r\nshe of course is wicked. Not only those who fast and go to mass are in\r\ndanger, but even those who are merely good in daily life. No one in\r\nthe village had seen her for two generations. I am not surprised. We\r\nall cross ourselves before we enter the water, but it is unnecessary.\r\nGiuseppe, we thought, was safer than most. We loved him, and many of us\r\nhe loved: but that is a different thing to being good.\"\r\n\r\nI asked who Giuseppe was.\r\n\r\n\"That day--I was seventeen and my brother was twenty and a great deal\r\nstronger than I was and it was the year when the visitors, who have\r\nbrought such prosperity and so many alterations into the village,\r\nfirst began to come. One English lady in particular, of very high\r\nbirth, came, and has written a book about the place, and it was through\r\nher that the Improvement Syndicate was formed, which is about to\r\nconnect the hotels with the station by means of a Funicular railway.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't tell me about that lady in here,\" I observed.\r\n\r\n\"That day we took her and her friends to see the grottoes. As we rowed\r\nclose under the cliffs I put out my hand, as one does, and caught a\r\nlittle crab, and having pulled off its claws offered it as a curiosity.\r\nThe ladies groaned, but a gentleman was pleased, and held out money.\r\nBeing inexperienced, I refused it, saying that his pleasure was\r\nsufficient reward! Giuseppe, who was rowing behind, was very angry with\r\nme and reached out with his hand and hit me on the side of the mouth,\r\nso that a tooth cut my lip, and I bled. I tried to hit him back, but\r\nhe always was too quick for me, and as I stretched round he kicked me\r\nunder the arm pit, so that for a moment I could not even row. There was\r\na great noise among the ladies, and I heard afterwards that they were\r\nplanning to take me away from my brother and train me as a waiter. That\r\nat all events never came to pass.\r\n\r\n\"When we reached the grotto--not here, but a larger one--the gentleman\r\nwas very anxious that one of us should dive for money, and the ladies\r\nconsented, as they sometimes do. Giuseppe who had discovered how much\r\npleasure it gives foreigners to see us in the water, refused to dive\r\nfor anything but silver, and the gentleman threw in a two lira piece.\r\n\r\n\"Just before my brother sprang off he caught sight of me holding my\r\nbruise, and crying, for I could not help it. He laughed and said 'this\r\ntime, at all events, I shall not see the Siren!' and went into the blue\r\nwater without crossing himself. But he saw her.\"\r\n\r\nHe broke off, and accepted a cigarette. I watched the golden entrance\r\nrock and the quivering walls, and the magic water through which great\r\nbubbles constantly rose. At last he dropped his hot ash into the\r\nripples and turned his head away, and said:\r\n\r\n\"He came up without the coin. We pulled him into the boat, and he was\r\nso large that he seemed to fill it, and so wet that we could not dress\r\nhim. I have never seen a man so wet. I and the gentleman rowed back,\r\nand we covered Giuseppe with sacking and propped him up in the stern.\"\r\n\r\n\"He was drowned, then?\" I murmured, supposing that to be the point.\r\n\r\n\"He was not\" he cried angrily. \"He saw the Siren. I told you.\"\r\n\r\nI was silenced again.\r\n\r\n\"We put him to bed, though he was not ill. The doctor came, and took\r\nmoney, and the priest came and took more and smothered him with incense\r\nand spattered him with holy water. But it was no good. He was too\r\nbig--like a piece of the sea. He kissed the thumb-bones of San Biagio\r\nand they never dried till evening.\"\r\n\r\n\"What did he look like?\" I ventured.\r\n\r\n\"Like anyone who has seen the Siren. If you have seen her 'often and\r\noften' how is it you do not know? Unhappy, unhappy, unhappy because he\r\nknew everything. Every living thing made him unhappy because he knew it\r\nwould die. And all he cared to do was to sleep.\"\r\n\r\nI bent over my note book.\r\n\r\n\"He did no work, he forgot to eat, he forgot whether he had his clothes\r\non. All the work fell on me, and my sister had to go out to service. We\r\ntried to make him into a beggar, but he was too robust to inspire pity,\r\nand as for an idiot, he had not the right look in his eyes. He would\r\nstand in the street looking at people, and the more he looked at them\r\nthe more unhappy he became. When a child was born he would cover his\r\nface with his hands. If anyone was married--he was terrible then, and\r\nwould frighten them as they came out of church. Who would have believed\r\nhe would marry himself! I caused that, I. I was reading out of the\r\npaper how a girl at Ragusa had 'gone mad through bathing in the sea.'\r\nGiuseppe got up, and in a week he and that girl came in together.\r\n\r\n\"He never told me anything, but it seems that he went straight to her\r\nhouse, broke into her room, and carried her off. She was the daughter\r\nof a rich mine-owner, so you may imagine our peril. Her father came\r\ndown, with a clever lawyer, but they could do no more than I. They\r\nargued and they threatened, but at last they had to go back and we\r\nlost nothing--that is to say, no money. We took Giuseppe and Maria to\r\nthe Church and had them married. Ugh! that wedding! The priest made no\r\njokes afterwards and coming out the children threw stones.... I think I\r\nwould have died to make her happy; but as always happens, one could do\r\nnothing.\"\r\n\r\n\"Were they unhappy together then?\"\r\n\r\n\"They loved each other, but love is not happiness. We can all get love.\r\nLove is nothing. Love is everywhere since the death of Jesus Christ. I\r\nhad two people to work for now, for she was like him in everything--one\r\nnever knew which of them was speaking. I had to sell our own boat and\r\nwork under the bad old man you have to-day. Worst of all, people began\r\nto hate us. The children first--everything begins with them--and then\r\nthe women and last of all the men. For the cause of every misfortune\r\nwas--you will not betray me?\"\r\n\r\nI promised good faith, and immediately he burst into the frantic\r\nblasphemy of one who has escaped from supervision, cursing the\r\npriests, the lying filthy cheating immoral priests who had ruined his\r\nlife, who had murdered his brother and the girl, whom he dared not\r\nmurder back because they held the key of heaven and could ruin him in\r\nthe next life too. \"Thus are we tricked!\" was his cry and he stood up\r\nand kicked at the azure ripples with his feet, till he had obscured\r\nthem with a cloud of sand.\r\n\r\nI too was moved. The story of Giuseppe, for all its absurdity and\r\nsuperstition, came nearer to reality than anything I had known before.\r\nI don't know why, but it filled me with desire to help others--the\r\ngreatest of all our desires I suppose, and the most fruitless. The\r\ndesire soon passed.\r\n\r\n\"She was about to have a child. That was the end of everything. People\r\nsaid to me 'When will your charming nephew be born? What a cheerful\r\nattractive child he will be, with such a father and mother!' I kept my\r\nface steady and replied 'I think he may be. Out of sadness shall come\r\ngladness'--it is one of our proverbs. And my answer frightened them\r\nvery much, and they told the priests, who were frightened too. Then the\r\nwhisper started that the child would be Anti-Christ: you need not be\r\nafraid: he was never born.\r\n\r\n\"An old witch began to prophesy, and no one stopped her. Giuseppe and\r\nthe girl, she said, had silent devils, who could do little harm. But\r\nthe child would always be speaking and laughing and perverting, and\r\nlast of all he would go into the sea and fetch up the Siren into the\r\nair and all the world would see her and hear her sing. As soon as\r\nshe sang, the Seven Vials would be opened and the Pope would die and\r\nMongibello flame, and the veil of Santa Agata would be burnt. Then the\r\nboy and the Siren would marry, and together they would rule the world,\r\nfor ever and ever.\r\n\r\n\"The whole village was in tumult, and the hotel keepers became\r\nalarmed, for the tourist season was just beginning. They met together\r\nand decided that Giuseppe and the girl must be sent inland until the\r\nchild was born, and they subscribed the money. The night before they\r\nwere to start there was a full moon and wind from the east, and all\r\nalong the coast the sea shot up over the cliffs in silver clouds. It is\r\na wonderful sight, and Maria said she must see it once more.\r\n\r\n\"'Do not go,' I said. 'I saw the priest go by, and someone with him.\r\nAnd the hotel keepers do not like you to be seen, and if we displease\r\nthem also we shall starve.'\r\n\r\n\"'I want to go,' she replied. 'The sea is stormy, and I may never feel\r\nit again.'\r\n\r\n\"'No, he is right' said Giuseppe. 'Do not go--or let one of us go with\r\nyou.'\r\n\r\n\"'I want to go alone,' she said; and she went alone.\r\n\r\n\"I tied up their luggage in a piece of cloth, and then I was so unhappy\r\nat thinking I should lose them that I went and sat down by my brother\r\nand put my arm round his neck, and he put his arm round me, which\r\nhe had not done for more than a year, and we remained thus I don't\r\nremember how long.\r\n\r\n\"Suddenly the door flew open and moon-light and wind came in together,\r\nand a child's voice said laughing 'They have pushed her over the cliffs\r\ninto the sea.'\r\n\r\n\"I stepped to the drawer where I keep my knives, and the child ran away.\r\n\r\n\"'Sit down again' said Giuseppe--Giuseppe of all people! 'If she is\r\ndead, why should others die too?'\r\n\r\n'I guess who it is,' I cried, 'and I will kill him.'\r\n\r\n\"I was almost out of the door but he tripped me up and kneeling upon me\r\ntook hold of both my hands and sprained my wrists; first my right one,\r\nthen my left. No one but Giuseppe would have thought of such a thing.\r\nIt hurt more than you would suppose, and I fainted. When I woke up, he\r\nwas gone, and I have never seen him again.\"\r\n\r\nBut Giuseppe disgusted me.\r\n\r\n\"I told you he was wicked,\" he said. \"No one would have expected him to\r\nsee the Siren.\"\r\n\r\n\"How do you know he did see her then?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because he did not see her 'often and often' but once.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why do you love him if he is wicked?\"\r\n\r\nHe laughed for the first time. That was his only reply.\r\n\r\n\"Is that the end?\" I asked, feeling curiously ashamed.\r\n\r\n\"I never killed her murderer, for by the time my wrists were well,\r\nhe was in America; and one cannot kill a priest. As for Giuseppe, he\r\nwent all over the world too, looking for someone else who has seen the\r\nSiren--either a man, or, better still, a woman, for then the child\r\nmight still have been born. At last he came to Liverpool,--is the\r\ndistrict probable?--and there he began to cough, and spat blood until\r\nhe died.\r\n\r\n\"I do not suppose there is anyone living now who has seen her. There\r\nhas seldom been more than one in a generation, and never in my life\r\nwill there be both a man and a woman from whom that child can be born,\r\nwho will fetch up the Siren from the sea, and destroy silence, and save\r\nthe world!\"\r\n\r\n\"Save the world?\" I cried. \"Did the prophecy end like that?\"\r\n\r\nHe leant back against the rock, breathing deep. Through all the\r\nblue-green reflections I saw him colour. I heard him say: \"Silence and\r\nloneliness cannot last for ever. It may be a hundred or a thousand\r\nyears, but the sea lasts longer, and she shall come out of it and\r\nsing.\" I would have asked him more, but at that moment the whole cave\r\ndarkened, and there rode in through its narrow entrance the returning\r\nboat.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE HOGARTH PRESS\r\n\r\n  Telephone                                         Hogarth House\r\n  Richmond 496                                      Paradise Road\r\n                                                         Richmond\r\n                                                           Surrey\r\n\r\n\r\n                  LIST OF PUBLICATIONS\r\n\r\n\r\nNEW PUBLICATIONS\r\n\r\nReminiscences of Leo Nicolayevitch Tolstoi.

So\r\n            he invented a camera lens for special effects--\r\n\r\n                      And All The Girls Were Nude\r\n\r\n                          By Richard Magruder\r\n\r\n           [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\r\n              Imagination Stories of Science and Fantasy\r\n                             December 1954\r\n         Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\r\n         the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\r\n\r\n\r\nAppearances oftentimes can be deceiving, and things most certainly\r\n_aren't_ always as they seem. Take the case of Nathanial Evergood, for\r\ninstance.\r\n\r\nThe nature of this old man was such that nobody ever called him Nat,\r\nnot even his closest working companions in the company's bookkeeping\r\ndepartment. As long as any of them had ever known Nathanial Evergood\r\nthere had never been the slightest indication of any desire of his for\r\nintimacy or even friendship.\r\n\r\nNot once had he shared a drink or lunch or relaxed conversation with\r\nanyone, so far as his associates knew. To say Nathanial was reserved is\r\nputting it mildly.\r\n\r\nIt would be more accurate to describe this little old man as\r\ndull--completely and absolutely dull. In his appearance, his dress, his\r\nspeech, in every way imaginable.\r\n\r\nBut, in addition to being quite dull--as everyone knew, Nathanial\r\nEvergood was also a thoroughly evil and obscene old man, as no one knew.\r\n\r\nLikely, the main reason no one had ever seen the inside of Nathanial's\r\nrooms was the fear within him that his evilness and obscenity might\r\nbe discovered. For Nathanial Evergood might be called a connoisseur,\r\nto slightly distort the meaning of that word. He could be called a\r\nconnoisseur of femininity--from afar, and in secret, of course. An\r\narbiter of the well-turned thigh, the rounded, dimpled bottom, the\r\ntight waist, and the high, firm bosom.\r\n\r\nOh, Nathanial Evergood was a connoisseur, all right. At the\r\ninvestigation he ventured a very rough but conservative guess that he\r\nhad collected at least fifty thousand pictures of girls, in whole or in\r\npart, horizontal or vertical, semi-nude or nude, over the years.\r\n\r\nUpon entering his living room (if that were possible), the first thing\r\na casual observer would have noted would be the point of saturation\r\nreached by his walls in their photographic content. There were\r\nphotographs of blonds and brunettes and redheads. There were pictures\r\nof thin girls, fat girls, girls with ample bosoms and girls lacking,\r\ngirls holding telephones, books and ice cream cones, girls sixteen,\r\ngirls twenty-five, and girls no longer girls.\r\n\r\nThere were shots in glorious color by the hundreds, originals and\r\nprints alike. But, there wasn't among them one single view of the Grand\r\nCanyon. Nor even a solitary Indian astride a tired horse, looking\r\npensively out over the prairie. There _was_ a red-skinned maiden, mind\r\nyou, but she wasn't sitting a horse, and she certainly wasn't staring\r\nlaconically out over any prairie, either. Rather, she appeared to\r\nbe testing with her toe the water temperature of a tree-shaded brook\r\nsomewhere, and she was clad in a lone, strategically-located feather.\r\n\r\nOn the tea table, in the bookshelves, in the magazine rack, and all\r\nthrough his rooms, one might find other evidence of this evil and\r\nobscene old man's preoccupation with womankind. But the kind of woman\r\nhe was preoccupied with often wasn't the kind that married dear old\r\ndad. He subscribed to every girlie publication in the country and to\r\nseveral in France.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSo you see, Nathanial Evergood was not only a connoisseur, he was also\r\nan avid collector. There were books and there were magazines, and there\r\nwas even a deck of playing cards backed with the most astounding set of\r\npictures you ever saw. That anyone could sit down to a game of Old Maid\r\nor Snap with _that_ deck of cards is inconceivable, to say the least.\r\nBut such an evil and obscene old man as Nathanial Evergood likely never\r\nplayed games with his cards, anyway. He would much prefer to just sit\r\nand look at them; the reverse side, of course.\r\n\r\nHe later said he probably spent almost half his really quite meager\r\nearnings for up-to-date additions to his extensive collection. The\r\ngirlie magazines, playing cards and prints he received from various\r\nmail order houses, sent, as the advertisements testified, \"in a plain,\r\nunmarked envelope\".\r\n\r\nBut the other half of his collection--the photographs, mounted,\r\nunmounted, matte and glossy enlargements and contact prints--Nathanial\r\nEvergood came by in an entirely different--and somewhat novel--manner.\r\nThese resulted from his ability as a fairly advanced amateur\r\nphotographer. Over the years, Nathanial had acquired three fine\r\ncameras, an excellent enlarger, two contact printers, electronic\r\nflash units, interchangeable lenses, filters, sun shades and lens\r\ncaps, extension tubes and tripods. In short, Nathanial Evergood was\r\nwell-equipped to take photographs of just about everything.\r\n\r\nHe had the equipment, and he had the necessary technical knowledge\r\nand facility. But, invariably, he passed up the usual pictorial,\r\narchitectural, human interest, interpretive and abstract photographs,\r\neven when the opportunities for truly fine shots were there. Instead,\r\nhe took roll after roll, pack after pack and cartridge upon cartridge\r\nof girls. _Nothing_ but girls. All _sorts_ of girls. _Just girls!_\r\n\r\nAt the investigation Nathanial suggested that the presence of a camera,\r\nintroduced on the scene in a gentlemanly and courteous manner, was\r\nenough to cause almost frenzied unlocking and unzipping by even the\r\nmost demure and prudish female. \"Ladies,\" Nathanial said wisely, \"love\r\nto have their bodies recorded for posterity.\"\r\n\r\nOh, he was certainly a very evil and highly obscene old man--was\r\nNathanial Evergood--if ever you saw one.\r\n\r\nBut the full import of what his evil old soul and obscene little mind\r\ncontained would probably escape the casual observer, unless he happened\r\nonto a tiny cubbyhole at the back of the rooms occupied by Nathanial.\r\nThis was the sanctum sanctorum, so to speak, of his thin little heart,\r\nfor here Nathanial Evergood guarded jealously a secret utterly beyond\r\nbelief.\r\n\r\nHe fancied himself to be something of an inventor. And he was, too--of\r\na sort. His ardent and relentless pursuit of photographic subject\r\nmatter during the years had led him into situations demanding full\r\nknowledge of his craft, from a technical rather than from an artistic\r\npoint of view. Thus, this inventive turn of mind was given an able\r\nassist by his understanding of the theory, optics and chemistry of\r\nphotography.\r\n\r\nAnd now, he was just putting the finishing touches to the most\r\nimportant project in his entire life.\r\n\r\nBasing his plan of action on the simple optical theory of astigmatism,\r\nNathanial designed a lens. Astigmatism, he had learned, results in the\r\nhuman eye, as well as in manufactured lenses of certain formulae, in\r\nthe failure of horizontal and vertical target lines to reach a common\r\nfocus. So his lens was designed intentionally astigmatic, allowing\r\nfocus to be brought on one group of target lines or another, but never\r\non both simultaneously.\r\n\r\nTo the front of the lens mount he added a front-surfaced prism and\r\na filter, carefully ground and tinted internally the precise color\r\ncomplement of human flesh. He reasoned, quite accurately as it turned\r\nout, that the prism would gather all the colors of light together\r\nand converge them at the focal plane of the lens as pure white, thus\r\neliminating all color. But, at the same instant, the complement\r\nfilter replaced last the flesh color of the object focused upon, and\r\nsubsequently recorded on film.\r\n\r\nThen, in one fell swoop, the lens allowed Nathanial to focus carefully\r\non one group of target lines (in his case, the female form underneath\r\nits covering), automatically throwing an opposing group of lines out\r\nof focus (the covering over the female body, in his case). The prism\r\nwas busily gathering together all color and converting it into pure\r\nwhite light, while lastly, the complementary filter replaced the color\r\nof flesh to the image, and finally to the photograph. You see the\r\npossibilities, of course. By replacing the normal lens of one fine\r\ncamera with his invention, Nathanial Evergood was now equipped to\r\nphotograph in rich, natural color the female form-divine, unfettered by\r\nany or all clothing.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWell, this day in particular, Nathanial Evergood stationed himself,\r\npoised like a pointer, at his window, camera in hand, invention in\r\nplace, waiting impatiently for the first likely subject to appear.\r\nAnd, shameful as it must seem, this evil and obscene old man was quite\r\nnoticeably drooling, right from one side of his pinched little mouth.\r\n\r\nHe heard the saucy click of her heels on the pavement a full thirty\r\nseconds before she swung gracefully into his myopic line of sight. She\r\nwas blondish. Not _too_ blond, understand, but just blond enough. And\r\nshe was a true-blue blond at heart, if you know what I mean.\r\n\r\nShutter: set, at 1/200 of a second; diaphragm: f/5.6; film;\r\nReal-lifecolor; rangefinder: superimposed. Click. Click, click, click!\r\nFour shots, four beautiful pictures, in color, too, before she was\r\ngone on down the street.\r\n\r\nWith incredible speed this evil and obscene old man descended from his\r\nwindow perch and scuttered back to his little cubby hole. He darkened\r\nthe room and unloaded the automatic sheet film holder. No attempt can\r\nbe made to describe the gnawing impatience that Nathanial Evergood felt\r\nas he sloshed the sensitized emulsions through the series of solutions\r\nfor the precise time required for true color rendition, as, after\r\nninety long minutes, he washed the sheets, and finally held them up to\r\nthe light for a first wide-eyed look.\r\n\r\nShe was there, alright, his swaying blond. She was there. _All_ of her!\r\n\r\nWell sir, after filling his eyes--and his evil little mind--with the\r\nfour lovely images of the girl, Nathanial Evergood rushed to the\r\ndowntown camera shop, and wrote out a large check for their entire\r\nsupply of Real-lifecolor film. Then, back on the street, madly\r\nclicking, clicking, clicking. Every pretty girl that came along.\r\n_Every_ single one!\r\n\r\nOh, he had a time for himself, did this evil, obscene old man.\r\n\r\nThe next day was Sunday, happily for his designing brain, and there was\r\nno work. After a full night in his cubby hole developing sheet after\r\nsheet of color film, Nathanial went to the beach and, as you must know\r\nby now, set his camera shutter clicking like a miniature machine gun.\r\n\r\nAnd, again, the results were spectacular, to put it mildly. The\r\ncollection grew and grew and grew, and Nathanial Evergood was never\r\nwearier, or never happier. What an evil, obscene man he was!\r\n\r\nNow, if Nathanial had stuck to his camera and to his wonderful\r\ninvention, this story might never have been written. But, evil and\r\nobscene as he was, he soon began to dream of new worlds to conquer.\r\n\r\nSimple as it had been to apply the principle of astigmatism to\r\nphotography--and with such marvelous results--why not apply this same\r\nprinciple to his eyeglasses? This would eliminate the annoying delay of\r\ntaking pictures, then developing and viewing them. To say nothing of\r\nthe terrific expense involved.\r\n\r\nUsually, when writers say, \"No sooner said than done\", it is often a\r\ngross exaggeration. But Nathanial _was_ quick about it, nevertheless.\r\n\r\nIn short order, the problems of focus, image distortion and aberrations\r\nwere ironed out, and Nathanial ventured once again out into the street\r\nto give his newest brain-child its dry-run, so to speak.\r\n\r\nThe glasses worked all right. They worked just fine. And Nathanial\r\nEvergood, in a leering ecstasy, raced up and down the streets, peering\r\nwith his watery and overworked eyes this way and that, up and down, all\r\naround and back again. For the next day or so Nathanial was busy as a\r\nbee attending every beauty contest and fashion show in town, and even\r\nfound time for a quick run out to the girl's school.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe third day following the initial tests of his new seeing-eye\r\nglasses, Nathanial suddenly observed there were an uncommon lot of\r\nnicely constructed young ladies right in his own department at the\r\noffice. An opportunist, if ever there was one, Nathanial thought\r\nit just might be fun to give the remarkable spectacles a chance to\r\nseparate the women from the girls, and the girls from the children.\r\n\r\nThis he did and although his work suffered, he spent the better part\r\nof the day classifying the office help in various categories, and\r\nlearning there were at least two ladies who fell in no classification\r\nwhatsoever. It was the nicest day he had spent at the office in quite\r\nsome time, he decided.\r\n\r\nNot long after that the strain brought on by the frequent changes from\r\nhis normal reading glasses to the prism spectacles became so intense\r\nthat he decided there was really no good reason why he shouldn't\r\njust wear them--the new ones, of course--all the time. The better to\r\npreserve his vision, and the better to pursue his avocation.\r\n\r\nSo, he did.\r\n\r\nAnd therein lay the downfall of Nathanial Evergood.\r\n\r\nFor, you see, the climax of our story comes a month later, on a sunny\r\nJuly day, when Nathanial made his decision to take a short stroll among\r\nthe mid-day lady shoppers downtown.\r\n\r\nUnderstand, with those glasses of his, Nathanial had become so\r\naccustomed to seeing his fellow creatures _au natural_, as it were,\r\nthat it was on the verge of becoming almost commonplace. But, evil and\r\nobscene as he was, it was still highly diverting yet.\r\n\r\nAt any rate, on this particular day, Nathanial had made his way no more\r\nthan a couple of hundred feet from his front door when a heavy hand was\r\nclamped on his shoulder and a rough voice growled, \"Where you think\r\n_you're_ going, you scrawny old buzzard? You oughta know better.\"\r\n\r\nNathanial Evergood spun about, suddenly petrified. The uniform, of\r\ncourse, was invisible, and the man was no raving beauty, he'd have\r\nsaid. But there was no mistaking the ugly gun and the shiny badge and\r\nthe authoritative tone of voice.\r\n\r\n\"I _beg_ your pardon,\" Nathanial spluttered indignantly. \"Just what is\r\nthe meaning of this ridiculous outrage?\"\r\n\r\nThe beefy Irish cop was even more indignant, though. \"Now, just look at\r\nyourself. I've seen absent-minded old timers parading down the street\r\nwith no shoes on, or even no pants on. But just look at yourself; not a\r\n_stitch_ on!\"\r\n\r\nNathanial Evergood looked down at himself in sudden horrified\r\nrealization, and looked back up as quickly. \"But ... but,\" he began,\r\n\"everybody else....\" But then, of course, he had to stop.\r\n\r\nWell, the upshot of it all was that the officer hauled him back into\r\nhis rooms to get some clothes on before carting him down to the station\r\nhouse. As it was before they entered the apartment, Nathanial stood to\r\nget ten days probation or a token fine for forgetting all his clothes,\r\nIrish cops being ordinarily an understanding lot.\r\n\r\nBut, when confronted by the staggering array of unclad femininity, this\r\nIrishman flushed a deep red, spewed an amazed Irish blasphemy, and then\r\nroared like a lion.\r\n\r\nAnd don't think the officer didn't check the evidence carefully--with\r\nthe proper degree of loathing, of course--before shoving Nathanial\r\nunceremoniously down the street to call the paddy wagon. Of a\r\ncertainty, things went much worse for the evil, obscene Nathanial\r\nEvergood than they might have, had not this righteously outraged\r\npoliceman done his duty as he saw it.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMatter of fact, they threw the book at the old boy. But not until a\r\nthorough investigation was made, and not until several hundred outraged\r\nmembers of every morals, anti-delinquency and anti-vice committee in\r\ntown had carefully checked and gasped over all the collected evidence.\r\nNever in the history of the city had there been such a hue and a cry\r\naroused for the punishment of an offender.\r\n\r\nSo, Nathanial Evergood--evil and obscene as ever--got five years for\r\npossession of pornography, indecent exposure and other charges. In the\r\nwords of the presiding jurist at the climax of the spectacular trial,\r\n\"Such a sentence is far too lenient a punishment for a crime of such\r\nenormity.\"\r\n\r\nAnd, to this very day, there rests in the files of the local\r\nconstabulary, the voluminous collection of Nathanial Evergood,\r\noccupying fourteen huge, well-worn cabinets, and always on display\r\nfor the indignant and affronted eyes of any anti-sin committeeman who\r\nwishes to examine it.\r\n\r\nAlso taken as evidence was Nathanial's wonderful prismatic lens and his\r\nmarvelous glasses. Anytime you're by the station house, drop into the\r\nchief's office and, there in the open cabinet opposite his desk, you\r\ncan see the venal objects. Now though, the lenses are pretty scratched\r\nand worn, but they're still the same two inventions of that ingenious,\r\nbut evil and obscene old man, Nathanial Evergood, No. 5-049,870.\r\n\r\nAnd not that it makes much difference since the case is long past and\r\nclosed, but it might be interesting to point out that the chief is\r\noften seen at beauty contests and fashion shows, wearing thick-lensed\r\nglasses, which, he explains, the optometrist prescribed for his failing\r\nsight. And I don't know if it's true or not, but they say the chief is\r\nalso the biggest customer the local camera shops have for a certain\r\nproduct called Real-lifecolor film.\r\n\r\nNot that it makes much difference now. Nathanial Evergood is serving\r\nhis sentence out, evil and obscene as ever, and the case is long past\r\nand closed."

SMITH\r\n\r\n                         Illustrated by Orban\r\n\r\n           [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\r\n              Astounding Science-Fiction, February 1947.\r\n         Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\r\n         the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\r\n\r\n\r\nRobert Hohmann smiled superciliously at the man before him. \"You have\r\nnerve,\" he said. It might have been a compliment excepting that the\r\ntone of the words was definitely sarcastic. \"You have the colossal\r\neffrontery to come here before me and tell me what I can do and what I\r\ncannot do.\"\r\n\r\nGreg Hammond said, quietly, \"Shall I repeat it? You are not to attempt\r\nthe construction of the plutonium producing uranium pile.\"\r\n\r\n\"Or else--what?\" sneered Hohmann.\r\n\r\n\"The United Nations makes no threats,\" said Greg. \"We are not a\r\nmilitary organization. We are the voice of the people--including yours,\r\nHohmann. We merely set forth that which the people desire, and remind\r\nthem of it. If someone--you in this case--goes against the will of the\r\npeople, it will be for the people to decide his fate.\"\r\n\r\n\"You do not understand,\" said Hohmann, \"nor can I possibly penetrate\r\nyour illogic reasoning. The person is secondary to the State. Therefore\r\nit is for the State to--\"\r\n\r\n\"The State is the result of the people,\" returned the United Nations\r\nrepresentative. \"Were it not for the people, there could be no State.\"\r\n\r\n\"Were it not for the State,\" thundered Hohmann in a ringing voice,\r\n\"people could not exist in the luxury they have. Man would still be\r\npitted against man and brother against brother. The State combines them\r\ninto an insoluble unit.\"\r\n\r\n\"The United Nations combines all States into an insoluble unit,\"\r\nreplied Hammond.\r\n\r\n\"Which believes itself capable of telling me what I can and cannot do!\"\r\n\r\n\"You, as dictator, find little trouble in telling your subjects just\r\nhow and what to do. You back up your demands with threats of death.\"\r\n\r\nHohmann smiled contentedly. \"So, my bright young friend, you must admit\r\nthat your United Nations organization is no different than Robert\r\nHohmann, dictator. I issue orders which may conflict with the desires\r\nof some of my people. You issue orders which occasionally conflict with\r\nsome of the desires of your States. Mine in this case.\"\r\n\r\n\"We issue orders only when the desires of a State are directed against\r\nthe common cause,\" said Hammond.\r\n\r\n\"A common cause decided by people other than those who will benefit\r\nfrom my act,\" snapped Hohmann.\r\n\r\n\"This gets us nowhere,\" said Hammond with an air of finality. \"You are,\r\ntherefore, directed to cease in your plan to construct the plutonium\r\nproducing uranium pile.\"\r\n\r\n\"The trouble with democratic organizations,\" said Hohmann sourly, \"is\r\nthat they will go to any lengths to preserve their people. Even to the\r\npoint of permitting, under democratic principle, the existence of an\r\norganization directed against the democracy itself. This, they claim,\r\nshows the true strength of democracy, since if it stands even when\r\npermitting an outfit to bore from within against it, it is therefore\r\nstrong. A single man is worth more than the seat of government! Ha!\r\nWell, we shall start our uranium pile, and we shall produce plutonium.\r\nAnd by the time your democratic organization gets through arguing,\r\nvoting, and deciding what to do about us--then preparing for it--and\r\nfinally acting, we can and will be unbeatable. As for you, who have the\r\ntemerity to come here with your toothless demand, you shall be hostage,\r\na worker willing or unwilling in the initial plutonium separation\r\nplant!\" Hohmann turned to the guards and said: \"Remove him!\"\r\n\r\nGreg Hammond was led from the large hall amid the jeers of Hohmann's\r\ncohorts. As he left, a discussion started upon the construction of the\r\nillegal uranium pile.\r\n\r\nHammond went quietly. He knew that he had the backing of the world,\r\nand the world would not let him down. He was convinced that Hohmann's\r\nremark was right. Greg Hammond was more valuable than government\r\nitself--and government would not let him die.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHohmann was no fool. The dictator knew that he was bucking the combined\r\nresources of the world, and it worried him somewhat, even though he\r\nput up a brave front and daily told his people that the United Nations\r\nwould not act against him.\r\n\r\nThe espionage that went on reported that little was being done. Hohmann\r\ntrebled the external espionage, and multiplied the internal agencies\r\ntenfold. He was taking no chances. Materials shipped into his country\r\nwere followed to the addressee, who was then investigated. Every mail\r\ncarrier and delivery boy was a member of Hohmann's Intelligence Group.\r\nShipments of manufactured articles were stopped or diverted; Hohmann\r\nknew that the plating on a cigar lighter might contain fissionable\r\nmaterial.\r\n\r\nBut there were no moves on the part of the United Nations that\r\nHohmann's Intelligence Group could detect.\r\n\r\nAnd it was the lack of action--even lack of anything other than\r\ndenunciation--that worried him into calling a Security Meeting.\r\n\r\nHis hall filled to overflowing with higher-ups, Robert Hohmann faced\r\nthem and said:\r\n\r\n\"We are here because of a singular lack of activity on the part of\r\nthose who have reason to fear us. Reprisals may come in many ways,\r\nsome of them must be new and terrible, even though they are now\r\nundetectable. The problem of the pushbutton war is known to all--why\r\ndrop bombs when bombs may be shipped in among the incoming merchandise,\r\nassembled in a tall tower, and touched off by radio. We, therefore,\r\nmust locate the manner of the reprisals.\"\r\n\r\nWorried faces nodded.\r\n\r\n\"This is no war of nerves,\" thundered Hohmann. \"It is possible to\r\ncause mental confusion in someone by merely ignoring his overt act--he\r\neventually spends more time worrying about what you intend to do about\r\nit than he does in preparation. This will not work. Admittedly we\r\nhave multiplied our Intelligence Group in an effort along this same\r\nreasoning. The lack of action on the part of the United Nations has\r\ncaused some concern. But we are not an individual, and we can divert a\r\ncarefully calculated number of workers to investigate while the rest of\r\nus can prepare for war. The problem, again I must admit, has achieved a\r\nrather overrated proportion, hence this meeting.\"\r\n\r\nProfessor Haldrick looked up at Hohmann and said, quietly, \"In other\r\nwords, Führer Hohmann, even though you state that the so-called war of\r\nnerves cannot succeed, we are meeting to solve that very problem?\"\r\n\r\nHohmann hissed at Haldrick and snarled for the professor to be quiet.\r\n\r\n\"Now,\" said Hohmann, \"what has been occurring lately that might\r\npossibly be construed as being out of the line of ordinary happenings?\"\r\n\r\nGeneral Friedrice shrugged. \"I must admit that the mail has increased\r\nmarkedly since Hammond's incarceration. Letters pour in from all over\r\nthe world to this government bureau and that government agency. They\r\nplead, they cajole, and they call names.\"\r\n\r\n\"I can imagine your fear at being called names,\" laughed Hohmann.\r\n\r\n\"Indeed, we are cringing abjectly,\" replied General Friedrice, who\r\nwould have had to reduce his figure by at least seventy pounds before\r\nhe could possibly cringe without hurting himself. \"We find ourselves in\r\na rather strange circumstance, however. These letters are, of course,\r\nsaved. This makes for too much paper work.\"\r\n\r\n\"We can take care of that,\" said Hohmann idly.\r\n\r\n\"I know. But that is the only thing I know of,\" said Friedrice.\r\n\r\n\"Enough,\" said Hohmann. \"This is another example of the\r\nconfusion-method. Our enemies hope to worry us by doing nothing--which\r\nis expected to make us fear something ultra-secret. Well, to a certain\r\nextent they have worried us. Not to any dangerous point, however,\r\nfor we are too strong to be defeated by a mental condition. This\r\noverbearing arrival of letters is another thing. All letters must be\r\nopened and read, for some of them do contain much valuable information.\r\nThey must all be saved and filed, for unless we have previous letters\r\nfrom some correspondent, we cannot know by comparison, whether a\r\nfuture letter containing information is false or true. A letter giving\r\ninformation that comes from a known correspondent who is helpful in\r\nthe past will be treated with more respect than the same information\r\ncoming from someone who has written reams of misdirection, falsity, and\r\nranting notes depicting dire results if we do not release Hammond and\r\nbehave ourselves.\"\r\n\r\nHohmann shrugged.\r\n\r\n\"Even so, we cannot be shunted aside,\" he added. \"We have plenty\r\nof people who can take care of the misdirection, just to see that\r\nsomething isn't happening to us. The rest of us can continue preparing.\r\nWhich brings me to another point.\"\r\n\r\nHohmann paused dramatically.\r\n\r\n\"When I press this key,\" he said, indicating the diamond-studded\r\ntelegraph-style key, \"the uranium pile will start to go. The key is\r\nconnected to the restrainer-rod controls of the pile; when pressed,\r\nthe rods leave the pre-set positions of no-reaction and fall under the\r\nautomatic controlling circuits. The pile will then start functioning at\r\napproximately ten kilowatts. After checking, it will be advanced to\r\na more productive power, and we are making the first step toward our\r\nglorious future.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA commotion started at the door, and everybody's head turned to see the\r\nguards bringing in Greg Hammond.\r\n\r\nHe shrugged off the guards and faced Hohmann defiantly.\r\n\r\n\"The United Nations have not stopped me,\" said Hohmann.\r\n\r\n\"The United Nations will never try to stop you,\" said Hammond quietly.\r\n\"We can only advise. Whatever is done, whatever may be started, we only\r\nadvise. You make your own future, Hohmann. Every man makes his own\r\nfuture. And up until he starts that which is forbidden, he may stop\r\nwith no danger. Once your uranium pile is started, Dictator Hohmann,\r\nyou cannot retrack.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am about to start it now,\" smiled Hohmann.\r\n\r\n\"I warn you again to stop and think. You are not violating our laws\r\nuntil you press that key, therefore we can initiate no punishment. Once\r\nthe key is pressed and the uranium pile starts, you are a violator and\r\nsubject to punishment.\"\r\n\r\nHohmann laughed uproariously. \"This starting will be secret,\" he said.\r\n\"Just as any starting may be secret. I, give me credit for it, gave\r\nwarning; otherwise we might have completed our pile of bombs and been\r\nready to attack before your precious, toothless organization could\r\nact.\"\r\n\r\n\"We may not be toothless,\" said Hammond. \"I ask you to consider, and\r\nonce again warn you to desist. Building the pile is a misdemeanor.\r\nProducing plutonium is outlawed. The final analysis, Hohmann, is\r\nwhether the plutonium is separated or not.\"\r\n\r\nHohmann laughed again. \"You cavil,\" he told the United Nations\r\nrepresentative. \"First it was mere contemplation that was evil. Then\r\nthe start was considered evil. Now we find that you think it dangerous\r\nbut not evil until we start the pile. Next you tell us that we can\r\nstart our pile providing we do not use the plutonium it produces.\r\nEach time you back up--like the average democracy. Your final step of\r\ncourse, is to protest vigorously while the bombs are exploding in your\r\ncities. Fool!\"\r\n\r\nHe reached for the key.\r\n\r\n\"Stop,\" said Hammond. \"It is dangerous.\"\r\n\r\n\"So is crossing any street,\" said Führer Hohmann.\r\n\r\nHe pressed the key vigorously, and a simultaneous flash went off,\r\ntaking his picture for history. Somewhere in the country, well hidden\r\nand removed from danger to the populace, the control rods moved, and\r\na flow of neutrons started to pass upward through the great pile of\r\nuranium and moderator.\r\n\r\nThe nerves of the men present twitched. Strain. Those who held fear of\r\nreprisals were half expecting something dire to happen simultaneously\r\nwith the start of the pile. Those who had no fear felt the surge of\r\nexultation as they took their first real step towards world domination.\r\n\r\nIt grew warm in the room, but nothing happened. Then as the first\r\nreport came in that the uranium pile was working, Hohmann dismissed the\r\naudience with a grand promise for the future.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFührer Hohmann faced General Unger with fury. \"You must be more\r\ncareful!\" exploded Hohmann.\r\n\r\n\"But I am careful,\" returned the general.\r\n\r\n\"Then why do I receive a letter that is radioactive?\" demanded Hohmann\r\nangrily. \"Feel it--it is warm!\"\r\n\r\nUnger felt the letter but felt nothing untoward. \"I feel nothing,\" he\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\nHohmann opened a cabinet and removed a counter. He held the letter to\r\nit and the counter clicked in rapid succession.\r\n\r\n\"See?\" stormed Hohmann. \"Now, before you find yourself removed from\r\npublic--and private--life, tell me how and why this must happen?\"\r\n\r\n\"If it actually happened, it is an error, and some underling will be\r\ntreated severely--\"\r\n\r\n\"The head will be treated severely as a warning,\" shouted Hohmann.\r\n\"Pass no buck, Unger. Your men are responsible to you--but you are\r\nequally responsible for them. Me--I think I will kill you myself! You\r\nmight have deprived our people of a leader!\"\r\n\r\nHohmann advanced toward the general, who faded back away from him.\r\nAcross the vast office went the two of them, slowly and stalking,\r\ncatlike. The general backed up, his face contorted with fear.\r\n\r\n\"Yesterday I start our pile,\" stormed Hohmann, \"and this morning I get\r\na radioactive letter! Twenty-four hours! Have you no shielding around\r\nthat pile?\" Hohmann grinned wolfishly. \"Seems to me that I should lock\r\nyou up in your own office over at the laboratory. Then you'd find that\r\nshielding is desirable, you idiot. Radiating like this--to render hot a\r\nletter, or pile of paper from which this letter came. Bah!\"\r\n\r\nHe went forward again, and General Unger felt the dilemma he was in.\r\nHe could not strike back; to kill this leader would bring about his\r\nown very slow and very painful death. To submit was death, but Hohmann\r\nwas a good pistol shot and it would be quick. Yet to prolong life for\r\nanother few precious moments, Unger retreated before the blazing eyes\r\nof his leader.\r\n\r\nHe backed, and felt the filing cabinets block his further retreat. He\r\nhad crossed the vast office, backwards.\r\n\r\nHe pressed back against the cabinets and felt a warm wave of fear flush\r\nup through him. It rose and rose, and he pressed harder and harder back\r\nagainst the cabinets--\r\n\r\nHis yell of pain shattered the air. Hohmann startled, and the pistol\r\nwent off with a loud racket. It missed, but General Unger was facing\r\naway from him, looking at the cabinets and rubbing his elbow.\r\n\r\nTentatively, Unger reached forward and touched a finger to the handle\r\nof the nearest file drawer.\r\n\r\nHe jerked it back, and blew upon it.\r\n\r\n\"Hohmann,\" he said. \"They're hot!\"\r\n\r\n\"Hot, you idiot?\" screamed Hohmann. He wet his forefinger and touched\r\nthe metal of the drawer. There was a faint sizzle and Hohmann jerked\r\nhis hand back too.\r\n\r\n\"Fire!\" he yelled, racing for an extinguisher. With a hook, he hurled\r\nthe drawer open and hit it with the spray. It exploded into a cloud,\r\na cloud that choked them and sent them from the room in a hurry. Hot\r\ncarbon tetrachloride vapor is not attractive.\r\n\r\nMen piled into the room, followed shortly by the official palace\r\nfiremen. Shortly the head man emerged.\r\n\r\n\"Führer,\" he said apologetically, \"the cabinets are hot, but there has\r\nbeen no fire.\"\r\n\r\n\"No fire? Then how--\"\r\n\r\nThe alarm rang again, and they raced to the office of General\r\nFriedrice, who was standing outside with a look of fear on his face.\r\n\r\n\"The file cabinets?\" asked Hohmann.\r\n\r\nThe general nodded dumbly.\r\n\r\n\"Fire?\"\r\n\r\n\"No--just hot.\"\r\n\r\n\"But there must be some reason--?\"\r\n\r\nGeneral Unger looked up nervously. \"Radioactivity?\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"But to collect that much radioactivity,\" said Hohmann, \"would take\r\ntime. And why was it not noticed sooner?\"\r\n\r\n\"That I do not know.\"\r\n\r\n\"Come--we'll read the Intelligence News Report,\" said Hohmann, leaving\r\non a dead run.\r\n\r\nHe had the tape in his hand as they came up with him; they listened to\r\nhis voice read the words from the tape.\r\n\r\n\"... mail carriers resign as mailboxes are hot to touch. Minor fire in\r\nbusiness offices of Greggham & Son, no damage done. Fire departments in\r\nall cities are rushed to danger points. Conference called to discuss\r\nthe outbreak of spontaneous fires in government offices. Professor\r\nHaldrick claims all fires not dangerous--\"\r\n\r\nHohmann turned to Unger. \"You're the head of Nuclear Physics,\" he\r\nstormed. \"I want a complete report in twenty-four hours!\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe hours passed. The fires grew. No longer were they merely hotboxes,\r\nbut in some important cases open flames broke out and consumed the\r\npaper. The charred ash continued to be too hot to the touch, and there\r\nwas panic in the country.\r\n\r\nUnger came at last. Dejected and pale with fear.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" stormed Hohmann, \"what is it?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm not certain other than its effect,\" said Unger shakily. \"All paper\r\nis artificially radioactive, and it heats up when the radioelements\r\napproach the critical mass--\"\r\n\r\n\"Get Hammond!\" screamed the dictator.\r\n\r\nThe United Nations representative was brought. He came with a smile.\r\n\r\n\"What is this?\" stormed Hohmann.\r\n\r\n\"Your own decision,\" replied the representative. \"You should not have\r\nstarted the pile.\"\r\n\r\n\"Go on,\" gritted Hohmann.\r\n\r\nGreg Hammond smiled. \"Plutonium has a characteristics radiation that we\r\ndo not quite understand,\" he explained. \"However, this radiation will\r\ncause fission in certain types of medium-long lived radioelements. The\r\nrange of the plutonium radiation is unknown, but it is great enough to\r\nbathe the entire country. You will find that most government offices\r\nare bulging with reams and reams of correspondence, many of which\r\nare over the critical mass. Nothing happens until someone turns on a\r\nplutonium-producing uranium pile, lets it run for a few hours, and the\r\naccumulation of plutonium starts. Right now, Hohmann, you have about\r\nfour hours before most of your government offices go sky-high--from\r\ntheir own red tape.\" Greg Hammond smiled. \"The United Nations only\r\nadvises,\" he said. \"And many millions of letters of advice arrived,\r\nall written on radioelemental paper. Had you taken that advice, the\r\npaper would have been innocuous inside of about thirty or forty years.\r\nYou did not. Now you have lost completely, Hohmann, for the radiation\r\nfrom that paper when bombarded with the plutonium radiation, produces a\r\nwhole string of secondary radioelements in your offices, in your desks,\r\nin your bodies, and in your air. The ash from burning is still hot,\r\nHohmann, and the trucks that will carry the deadly paper will be as\r\ndeadly. Your very country will be subject to slow fission if you start\r\nanother uranium pile for several hundred years. I'd advise you to stop\r\nthe one that is now running, Hohmann.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll let the world go up with me,\" screamed the dictator.\r\n\r\n\"That it will not do,\" said Hammond. \"You see; if you do not shut it\r\noff by yourself, we'll all be dead in an hour, after which my cohorts\r\ncan locate the pile with neither difficulty nor interference. Make your\r\nchoice, dictator. And remember, the United Nations only advises, never\r\ndemands. Our advice, however, may be said to be written with letters of\r\nfire.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n                               THE END."

And when she\r\n               got there, thirty-nine men were waiting._\r\n\r\n           [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\r\n             Worlds of If Science Fiction, February 1959.\r\n         Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\r\n         the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe pilot shoved open the airlock and kicked the stairs down.\r\n\r\n\"Okay, girls. Carry your suitcases and I'll give each of you an oxygen\r\nmask as you go out. The air's been breathable for fifteen years, but\r\nit's still thin to newcomers. If you feel dizzy, take a whiff of\r\noxygen.\"\r\n\r\nThe forty women just stood there and looked at each other. Nobody\r\nwanted to be first.\r\n\r\nAnnie moved forward, her bulky suitcase practically floating in her\r\nhand. She was a big woman with that wholesome expression which some\r\nwomen have to substitute for sex appeal. She'd made a great senior\r\nleader at summer camps.\r\n\r\n\"I'll go first,\" she said, grinning confidence into the others. \"I'm\r\nnot likely to bring out the beast in them.\" She waved herself out,\r\nletting the grin set and jell.\r\n\r\nIt was odd to feel light. She'd felt too heavy as far back as she could\r\nremember. Not fat heavy. Bone heavy.\r\n\r\nThe sweat on her face dried suddenly. She could feel it, like\r\nsomething being peeled off her skin. Arid climate.\r\n\r\nIt was cold. But she had the warmth to meet it.\r\n\r\nThere they were! Forty men. There were supposed to be forty. What if\r\none of them had died! Who would go back?\r\n\r\n\"Not me,\" Annie prayed to herself. \"Dear God, not me.\" She tried to\r\ncount them. But they moved around so!\r\n\r\nThey were looking at something. Not Annie. The girl coming down the\r\nramp behind Annie.\r\n\r\nIt was Sally, with the blonde hair on her shoulders. That's all they'd\r\nbe able to see from there. The blonde hair.\r\n\r\nBut a man was coming forward. He had a tam-like hat pulled low to\r\ngood-humored eyes, and an easy stride.\r\n\r\n\"Wait, Ben,\" one of the other men said. \"See the others.\"\r\n\r\n\"I pulled first, didn't I?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yeah. But you ain't seen but two yet.\"\r\n\r\n\"I want that blonde one. Let Gary see the others.\"\r\n\r\nAnd he led Sally away.\r\n\r\nHe didn't feel her muscles or look at her teeth or measure her pelvic\r\nspan.\r\n\r\nAfter Sally came Nora. Nora giggled and waved, making a shape under the\r\nshapeless clothes. Wasn't that just like Nora? Okay. So she was cute.\r\n\r\nSecond man took Nora. He didn't wait for the others.\r\n\r\nThird man took Regina. Regina looked scared, but you could see those\r\nbig cow eyes a mile off. Regina obviously needed somebody to protect\r\nher.\r\n\r\nThe other girls came out. Annie counted and her heart hit bottom.\r\nSomeone was going to be left over.\r\n\r\nFour women, three men. They all felt embarrassed. It was the kind of\r\nthing the colonists would talk about for years. Who was last. Who was\r\nsecond to last. Spiteful people would remember, and in a tight little\r\ncommunity, spite took root and throve on the least misinterpreted\r\nexpression or--But then, this wouldn't be a tight little community,\r\nAnnie remembered. The lichen farms were spread out over the whole\r\ntemperate belt of the world. Because the lichens were grown only on\r\nhills, where the sand would not cover them. And because they did a more\r\nefficient job of oxygenating the atmosphere when they were spread over\r\na wide area.\r\n\r\nOne man, hat in hand, even in the cold. A little shriveled man with a\r\nspike of dust-colored hair, but kind-looking.\r\n\r\n\"Aw....\" he drawled in embarrassment. He clicked his tongue. \"You're\r\nboth probably too good for somebody like me. I don't know. Both fine\r\nwomen.\"\r\n\r\nThe two women stood in silence.\r\n\r\n\"What's your name?\"\r\n\r\n\"Annie.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mary.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mary? My sister's named Mary. Fine woman.\" He took Mary's hand. \"No\r\ndisrespect to you, Annie.\"\r\n\r\nThey were all gone.\r\n\r\n\"I could take you on my Venus run,\" the pilot said. He, too, was\r\nembarrassed. \"But I'm afraid I'll have a full ship after that. Unless\r\nyou can buy the weight and space. I'd be glad to take you free. But the\r\ncompany....\"\r\n\r\nAnnie's eyes were full but she wasn't going to let them spill.\r\n\r\nSally brought Ben by, already looking self-consciously married.\r\n\r\n\"I'm sorry, honey,\" she said. \"Look, Annie, if you want to come stay\r\nwith us until another shipment of pioneers come to break ground, you're\r\nwelcome. Maybe you'd--er--find one of them you liked.\"\r\n\r\nIt was a gesture of kindness, of course, but it made Annie's eyes\r\nspill. She turned her head away, toward the red hills. Red and the\r\ncultivated ones green. Christmas colors.\r\n\r\n\"Sure,\" Ben said. \"Swell. Any friend of Sally's is a friend of mine.\"\r\n\r\nAnd the way they looked at each other made Annie's heart lurch.\r\n\r\n\"Thanks, kids,\" she said. \"But I don't believe I'll try it. And don't\r\nworry. This isn't the first time I've been stood up.\"\r\n\r\n\"Are you coming?\" the pilot shouted across the field. \"Hate to rush\r\nyou, but I've got a schedule to meet.\"\r\n\r\nWas she coming? What else could she do?\r\n\r\n\"What happened to him, Ben?\" Annie asked. \"My--the other man that\r\nshould have been here.\"\r\n\r\nBen worried a hole in the sand with one foot and cleared his throat.\r\n\"He stayed home.\"\r\n\r\n\"You mean he's _alive_! Here?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well ... yes. But he didn't--\"\r\n\r\n\"Never mind. I don't need anybody to strum a guitar under my window.\r\nIf he couldn't get away from the farm today I can certainly go to him.\r\nI've got a pair of legs that'll walk around the world.\"\r\n\r\n\"You coming?\" the pilot shouted.\r\n\r\n\"No!\" Annie cried. \"I live here.\"\r\n\r\nThe spaceship took off, a phoenix rising from the flames.\r\n\r\nBen was shuffling his feet, hands in his pockets. \"We'd be proud to\r\nhave you stay with us, Annie.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, cut it out, Ben. I'm no hot-house rose. Just tell me which way and\r\nI'll find my own farm.\" She paused, trying to guess his thoughts.\r\n\r\n\"You think he might be disappointed when he sees me? Is that it, Ben? I\r\nknow I'm no pinup girl. But I'm a worker and a breeder. He'll see it.\r\nIn the end, that's what's going to count.\"\r\n\r\nBen was still making holes in the sand with his feet, trying to say\r\nsomething.\r\n\r\n\"Please don't worry,\" Annie went on, \"your friend won't be sorry. If he\r\ndoesn't want to marry me right away--okay. I can understand it. But I\r\ncan give him a chance to watch me work.\"\r\n\r\n\"That isn't it,\" Ben said finally. \"I think you look fine, Annie.\r\nIt's--it's _any_ woman. He told them not to send a wife for him. _Any_\r\nwoman.\"\r\n\r\n\"But that's ridiculous. He knows the laws. Five years and then a wife.\r\nWhy did he stake out in the first place?\"\r\n\r\n\"That was before,\" Ben answered.\r\n\r\n\"Before what?\"\r\n\r\n\"Aw, it's not for me to say. Why don't you just forget Bradman. He's a\r\ngood enough guy. But not for you. You come--\"\r\n\r\n\"Which way and how far?\"\r\n\r\nBen looked at her hard. \"Okay. On Mars your life is your own.\" He\r\npointed. \"Second farmbubble you come to. And you'd better hurry. It\r\nought to take eight hours and night falls like a ton of bricks here.\"\r\n\r\nAnnie made it in seven. Easy.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nShe went up to the transparent hemisphere. He was inside working. She\r\nshouted, but if he heard her he didn't look up.\r\n\r\nShe went to the flap that must be the door. There wasn't anything to\r\nknock on, so she opened the flap and walked in.\r\n\r\nThere was nothing in the room but a cot, kitchen equipment and lichen,\r\ngrowing on a number of tables. The air was richer than outside and\r\nAnnie breathed it thirstily.\r\n\r\n\"I'm Annie Strug,\" she said, smiling and wishing it wasn't such an ugly\r\nname.\r\n\r\nHe glanced up, angry blue eyes under a growth of black hair. He didn't\r\nsay a word.\r\n\r\nAnnie set her suitcase down and looked out at the green growth on the\r\nhills.\r\n\r\n\"Look, Mr. Bradman,\" she cried suddenly, pointing a spatulate finger to\r\nthe western horizon. \"What in the name of heaven is that?\" There was a\r\ncatch of fright in her voice.\r\n\r\n\"We don't say 'mister' on Mars,\" he said reluctantly. \"Brady. But you\r\ndon't have to call me anything because you're leaving soon.\" He was a\r\nbig, arid man with a sandy voice. But his hands, as he stripped the\r\nlumpy brown fruits from a giant lichen, were surprisingly delicate.\r\n\r\n\"What _is_ it?\" Annie asked again, turning instinctively to the big man\r\nfor a reassurance and protection she had no reason to expect.\r\n\r\nBradman straightened and moved away from her, looking at the black\r\ngiant growing up from the earth in the distance and moving straight\r\ntoward them.\r\n\r\n\"It's a sandstorm,\" he said. \"It'll be here in ten minutes.\"\r\n\r\nAnnie let out the breath she had been holding. \"Oh. That doesn't sound\r\nso bad. I don't know what I thought it was. I was just frightened.\" She\r\nsmiled shyly and apologetically at Bradman.\r\n\r\nBradman grimaced at her, his agate eyes frozen in a pallid face that\r\nshould have gone with red hair. The sand-blown lines in his face were\r\ncruel. \"Sister, you've got a smile like a slab of concrete. Don't try\r\nit again.\"\r\n\r\n\"You didn't _have_ to say that,\" Annie said quietly, closing her eyes\r\nagainst the winds of her anger.\r\n\r\n\"You didn't have to come here,\" he replied. \"Goodbye.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm not leaving,\" she said, still holding tight the doors of her anger.\r\n\r\n\"_I_ am.\" He paced heavily over the sand floor and pulled back the flap\r\nof the door.\r\n\r\n\"Where are you going?\" Annie glanced back at the towering giant, now\r\nglowing red in the sunlight, like some huge, grotesque devil.\r\n\r\n\"Into the storm cellar. Nobody lives through a Martian sandstorm.\"\r\n\r\nAnnie ran after him. \"For God's sake take me with you! You can't leave\r\nme....\"\r\n\r\n\"Mine's built for one,\" he said, and pulled the top in over him as he\r\ndisappeared into the hole.\r\n\r\nAnnie broke her fingernails pulling at the cover. The wind was blowing\r\nsand in her eyes. She saw blood staining the rim of her index finger.\r\nShe pounded with her fists.\r\n\r\n\"Let me in!\" she screamed. \"In the name of God!\" But all she heard was\r\nthe keening sand in the wind.\r\n\r\nShe looked around. The devil was closer, malignant and hungry. It\r\nwanted to eat her alive.\r\n\r\nIt made her angry.\r\n\r\n\"I'll fight it,\" she screamed. \"By God, I'll fight!\"\r\n\r\nFive minutes, she guessed. Maybe five minutes left. She ran into the\r\nhouse, ripped open her suitcase. Bundles of nylon marriage clothes. She\r\nbegan to sob. Some were with lace.\r\n\r\n\"Fight!\" she shouted to herself. There was her oxygen mask. How much\r\noxygen? Anybody's guess. It was made for maybe a few whiffs a day over\r\na period of several months.\r\n\r\nSwell. But it wouldn't keep the sand from tearing through her eyeballs\r\nand flaying her alive.\r\n\r\nWrap in nylon nightgowns? Ridiculous.\r\n\r\nSpacesuit?\r\n\r\nAnnie went through the one-room house as fast as she could. No\r\nspacesuit. Why should he have one?\r\n\r\nThree minutes left.\r\n\r\nSand was blowing under the hemisphere, piling up at one end and oozing\r\nout beneath.\r\n\r\nIt was possible she would simply be buried.\r\n\r\nThe refrigerator!\r\n\r\nThat wasn't a refrigerator. Only a cabinet, loosely joined.\r\n\r\nAnnie went outside, on the side where the field of lichens grew up a\r\nsmooth, stone hill. The red devil was whistling at her now; a low,\r\ninsinuating whistle.\r\n\r\nSomething rattled faintly against one steel rib of the hemisphere. It\r\nwas a shrub, about five feet tall.\r\n\r\nAnnie began to laugh hysterically. Brady had protected the shrub with\r\nloving care. It was tied to the steel rib through grommetted holes in\r\nthe hemisphere, and covered with its own plastic bag to shield off the\r\nwind.\r\n\r\nOne minute.\r\n\r\nThe red devil was shouting now, laughing with triumph. He ran his sandy\r\nfingers through her hair and blew his gritty breath in her eyes.\r\n\r\nShe pulled the zipper at the bottom of the polyethylene bag that\r\ncovered the shrub and yanked the bag off. It was heavy, almost oily\r\nplastic, slippery and pliant.\r\n\r\nThere was no time to decide whether it would be better inside or\r\noutside the house. She pulled the bag over her head inside out, so the\r\nzipper would close completely. Then she folded the zipper part under\r\nonce and wedged herself as far as she could go into the space between\r\nshrub and hemisphere, holding the oxygen mask in her teeth.\r\n\r\nWith infinite care, though she was not likely to split the heavy bag,\r\nshe pulled off her shoes and her heavy, woollen walking socks. She put\r\nthe shoes back on. Her slacks covered her legs. Only her ankles were\r\nbare.\r\n\r\nShe unraveled one sock and stuffed the yarn in her ears. There was a\r\nsudden, remarkable quiet. Then, even through the yarn came the roar of\r\nthe storm. For it was upon her.\r\n\r\nShe looked through the milky plastic into a wild, red inferno, spitting\r\nat her in furious frustration. Then she bound the other sock over her\r\neyes.\r\n\r\nShe was in a blind, muffled world now, buffeted against the shrub and\r\nthe wires and the steel rib, but not painfully, because of her heavy\r\nclothing. It was as though suddenly all her senses had been switched to\r\nthe last pitch before silence.\r\n\r\n\"I might live,\" Annie thought. \"I might.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThere was sand in the bag now. Annie could feel it sifting under her\r\ncollar and blowing up her ankles. Not much. It was coming from the\r\nbottom of the bag. Probably the end of the zipper had worked open just\r\na little.\r\n\r\nWas that the dull roar of the storm through her stoppered ears or the\r\nrushing of her own blood? If sand were seeping in, the storm must still\r\nbe on.\r\n\r\nHow did Bradman breathe in his storm cellar? Would the storm last long\r\nenough for the air to go bad? It would go bad fast, in an enclosed\r\nplace on Mars.\r\n\r\nBradman. What sort of monster would walk off and let another human\r\nbeing die? Without a glance backwards? Did the cold desert wear the\r\nhumanity out of a man? How did a human being get like that?\r\n\r\n\"'You've got a smile like a concrete slab.'\" Is that what you say to a\r\nperson when you know you're about to leave them to die?\r\n\r\n    UNMARRIED WOMEN BETWEEN THE AGES OF 21 AND 30. GOOD HEALTH. WELL\r\n    ADJUSTED. MARRIAGE ON ARRIVAL. MARS TRANSPORT LEAVES OCT. 1.\r\n\r\nGood health ... well adjusted ... she could see the printed words, red\r\nstereo words reaching out from the page. Unmarried women between ...\r\nthey came and went in her mind and there was a roar in her ears. The\r\nwords were gone now. Only a redness that came and went. No. A blackness.\r\n\r\nAnnie snatched the exhausted oxygen mask off her face and gulped a\r\npallid, sandy breath of air. It wouldn't do. She took the sock off her\r\neyes and bound it around her nose and mouth. It would filter some of\r\nthe sand out. She opened her eyes briefly and closed them. The grit\r\nstayed in. She didn't dare open them again.\r\n\r\nBut the storm looked weaker. Or was it her imagination?\r\n\r\nShe groped for the zipper. Foul air would kill her quicker than sand.\r\nShe couldn't find it.\r\n\r\nHell with the zipper! She pulled her little mending kit out of her\r\npocket and slashed the bag with the scissors.\r\n\r\nThe storm sounded louder now, with the bag gone. The sand blew under\r\nher eyelids. Ripped her face. Tore a burning circle around each ankle.\r\n\r\nAnnie put her face in her hands, breathing through her nose and the\r\nsock.\r\n\r\nShe held herself stiffly. She didn't want to cough.\r\n\r\nThe whole world was a blind, gritty pain. There was no end to think of.\r\nOnly pain.\r\n\r\nA grayness.\r\n\r\nA blackness.\r\n\r\nFinally, a voice. Bradman.\r\n\r\n\"You ruined my shrub. Did you have to slash the bag, too?\"\r\n\r\nAnnie opened her eyes. They felt red and ruined. They were watering so\r\nmuch her cheeks were wet. She could hardly see.\r\n\r\nShe was having a coughing fit. She dragged herself upright. All she\r\ncould see was sand. The plastic bubble had blown off the girders and if\r\nthe furnishings and her suitcase were there, her eyes were still too\r\ndim to see them.\r\n\r\n\"Do you know what that shrub's worth on Mars?\"\r\n\r\nAnnie found the yarn had fallen out of one ear and she pulled it out\r\nof the other.\r\n\r\n\"Do you know what that _bag's_ worth?\"\r\n\r\nGall ran in her veins. She spat it out of her mouth.\r\n\r\nShe backed up to the steel beam and braced her feet against it, light\r\nin the Martian gravity.\r\n\r\n\"I told them not to send a woman out here.\"\r\n\r\nShe pushed off and sank her fist into his teeth. He went down.\r\n\r\nShe was too light. But he was too light, too. It evened out.\r\n\r\nShe turned his face and held it in the sand. Her strength was insane.\r\n\r\n\"Do you know what a human life is worth?\" she screamed.\r\n\r\nHe struggled, but she fought his bucking body, kept his face buried in\r\nthe sand until he was dead and a long time after.\r\n\r\nAn age passed. Annie was frozen in a world rimed over with white\r\nstarlight, sequinned with frost.\r\n\r\nThen the crosseyed moons came up.\r\n\r\nShe found an edge of the plastic bubble, rumpled and limp and half\r\nburied in the sand. She pushed off the heaviest hills of sand with her\r\nhands and pulled it out. She climbed up the anchored girders with it,\r\nand then slept the rest of the night in her own home.\r\n\r\nThe next day she dug out her household supplies from the sand.\r\n\r\nThe day after she cleared the sand from the lichens on her farm.\r\n\r\nOn the fourth day she called a few neighbors in and late in the evening\r\nshe buried Bradman.\r\n\r\nNo one questioned her. It had been, after all, self-defense.\r\n\r\nShe kept the farm as well as any man. Better. She worked. How she\r\nworked! She kept herself numb with labor, her mind drunk with the\r\nliquors of fatigue.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAfter five years, he came. He just appeared inside the door flap,\r\nlooking a little nervous but grinning.\r\n\r\n\"I'm Jack Hamstrong,\" he said, his voice full and wholesome, like Iowa\r\ncorn. \"I--you weren't at the spaceport so I figured, what the heck. I\r\njust walked.\"\r\n\r\n\"This is _my_ farm,\" Annie said. \"My hands are on every inch of it.\"\r\n\r\nHamstrong's ruddy face turned in on itself a little. \"I know. I know\r\nthe story. I didn't come to take anything away. I came to--good Lord,\r\ndidn't you _know_ you'd be sent a husband?\"\r\n\r\nAnnie's eyes went queer, like a cat's. \"A husband?\" If they'd told her,\r\nshe hadn't heard. \"Go away,\" she said. She looked around at her farm,\r\nthe fruits of her travail--alone. The virgin birth.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" he said firmly. \"It's yours _and_ mine. Legally. I'm not a mean\r\nman, Annie. You'll find me patient. But stubborn. I can wait.\"\r\n\r\nAnnie sighed. Or was it a shudder? She looked up again at the puckering\r\nedges of the evening sky.\r\n\r\nShe put down the knife she had been peeling a giant lichen with. She\r\nwiped her hands on her apron and lifted the door flap.\r\n\r\n\"All right, then,\" she said. \"Wait.\"\r\n\r\n\"For what?\"\r\n\r\n\"The sandstorm,\" she said.\r\n\r\nAnd she got into the storm cellar and pulled down the weighty lid,\r\nlocking it behind her."

After a Few Words ...\r\n\r\n                           by Seaton McKettrig\r\n\r\n                          Illustrated by Summer\r\n\r\n[Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from \"Analog\" October 1962.\r\nExtensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S. copyright\r\non this publication was renewed.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n     This is a science-fiction story. History is a science; the other\r\n     part is, as all Americans know, the most fictional field we have\r\n     today.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHe settled himself comfortably in his seat, and carefully put the helmet\r\non, pulling it down firmly until it was properly seated. For a moment,\r\nhe could see nothing.\r\n\r\nThen his hand moved up and, with a flick of the wrist, lifted the visor.\r\nAhead of him, in serried array, with lances erect and pennons flying,\r\nwas the forward part of the column. Far ahead, he knew, were the Knights\r\nTemplars, who had taken the advance. Behind the Templars rode the mailed\r\nknights of Brittany and Anjou. These were followed by King Guy of\r\nJerusalem and the host of Poitou.\r\n\r\nHe himself, Sir Robert de Bouain, was riding with the Norman and English\r\ntroops, just behind the men of Poitou. Sir Robert turned slightly in his\r\nsaddle. To his right, he could see the brilliant red-and-gold banner of\r\nthe lion-hearted Richard of England--_gules, in pale three lions passant\r\nguardant or_. Behind the standard-bearer, his great war horse moving\r\nwith a steady, measured pace, his coronet of gold on his steel helm\r\ngleaming in the glaring desert sun, the lions of England on his\r\nfirm-held shield, was the King himself.\r\n\r\nFurther behind, the Knights Hospitallers protected the rear, guarding\r\nthe column of the hosts of Christendom from harassment by the Bedouins.\r\n\r\n\"By our Lady!\" came a voice from his left. \"Three days out from Acre,\r\nand the accursed Saracens still elude us.\"\r\n\r\nSir Robert de Bouain twisted again in his saddle to look at the knight\r\nriding alongside him. Sir Gaeton de l'Arc-Tombe sat tall and straight in\r\nhis saddle, his visor up, his blue eyes narrowed against the glare of\r\nthe sun.\r\n\r\nSir Robert's lips formed a smile. \"They are not far off, Sir Gaeton.\r\nThey have been following us. As we march parallel to the seacoast, so\r\nthey have been marching with us in those hills to the east.\"\r\n\r\n\"Like the jackals they are,\" said Sir Gaeton. \"They assail us from the\r\nrear, and they set up traps in our path ahead. Our spies tell us that\r\nthe Turks lie ahead of us in countless numbers. And yet, they fear to\r\nface us in open battle.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is it fear, or are they merely gathering their forces?\"\r\n\r\n\"Both,\" said Sir Gaeton flatly. \"They fear us, else they would not dally\r\nto amass so fearsome a force. If, as our informers tell us, there are\r\nuncounted Turks to the fore, and if, as we are aware, our rear is being\r\ndogged by the Bedouin and the black horsemen of Egypt, it would seem\r\nthat Saladin has at hand more than enough to overcome us, were they all\r\ntruly Christian knights.\"\r\n\r\n\"Give them time. We must wait for their attack, sir knight. It were\r\nfoolhardy to attempt to seek them in their own hills, and yet they must\r\nstop us. They will attack before we reach Jerusalem, fear not.\"\r\n\r\n\"We of Gascony fear no heathen Musselman,\" Sir Gaeton growled. \"It's\r\nthis Hellish heat that is driving me mad.\" He pointed toward the eastern\r\nhills. \"The sun is yet low, and already the heat is unbearable.\"\r\n\r\nSir Robert heard his own laugh echo hollowly within his helmet. \"Perhaps\r\n'twere better to be mad when the assault comes. Madmen fight better than\r\nmen of cooler blood.\" He knew that the others were baking inside their\r\nheavy armor, although he himself was not too uncomfortable.\r\n\r\nSir Gaeton looked at him with a smile that held both irony and respect.\r\n\"In truth, sir knight, it is apparent that you fear neither men nor\r\nheat. Nor is your own blood too cool. True, I ride with your Normans and\r\nyour English and your King Richard of the Lion's Heart, but I am a\r\nGascon, and have sworn no fealty to him. But to side with the Duke of\r\nBurgundy against King Richard--\" He gave a short, barking laugh. \"I\r\nfear no man,\" he went on, \"but if I had to fear one, it would be Richard\r\nof England.\"\r\n\r\nSir Robert's voice came like a sword: steely, flat, cold, and sharp. \"My\r\nlord the King spoke in haste. He has reason to be bitter against Philip\r\nof France, as do we all. Philip has deserted the field. He has returned\r\nto France in haste, leaving the rest of us to fight the Saracen for the\r\nHoly Land leaving only the contingent of his vassal the Duke of Burgundy\r\nto remain with us.\"\r\n\r\n\"Richard of England has never been on the best of terms with Philip\r\nAugustus,\" said Sir Gaeton.\r\n\r\n\"No, and with good cause. But he allowed his anger against Philip to\r\ncolor his judgment when he spoke harshly against the Duke of Burgundy.\r\nThe Duke is no coward, and Richard Plantagenet well knows it. As I said,\r\nhe spoke in haste.\"\r\n\r\n\"And you intervened,\" said Sir Gaeton.\r\n\r\n\"It was my duty.\" Sir Robert's voice was stubborn. \"Could we have\r\npermitted a quarrel to develop between the two finest knights and\r\nwarleaders in Christendom at this crucial point? The desertion of Philip\r\nof France has cost us dearly. Could we permit the desertion of Burgundy,\r\ntoo?\"\r\n\r\n\"You did what must be done in honor,\" the Gascon conceded, \"but you have\r\nnot gained the love of Richard by doing so.\"\r\n\r\nSir Robert felt his jaw set firmly. \"My king knows I am loyal.\"\r\n\r\nSir Gaeton said nothing more, but there was a look in his eyes that\r\nshowed that he felt that Richard of England might even doubt the loyalty\r\nof Sir Robert de Bouain.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSir Robert rode on in silence, feeling the movement of the horse beneath\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nThere was a sudden sound to the rear. Like a wash of the tide from the\r\nsea came the sound of Saracen war cries and the clash of steel on steel\r\nmingled with the sounds of horses in agony and anger.\r\n\r\nSir Robert turned his horse to look.\r\n\r\nThe Negro troops of Saladin's Egyptian contingent were thundering down\r\nupon the rear! They clashed with the Hospitallers, slamming in like a\r\nrain of heavy stones, too close in for the use of bows. There was only\r\nthe sword against armor, like the sound of a thousand hammers against a\r\nthousand anvils.\r\n\r\n\"Stand fast! Stand fast! Hold them off!\" It was the voice of King\r\nRichard, sounding like a clarion over the din of battle.\r\n\r\nSir Robert felt his horse move, as though it were urging him on toward\r\nthe battle, but his hand held to the reins, keeping the great charger in\r\ncheck. The King had said \"Stand fast!\" and this was no time to disobey\r\nthe orders of Richard.\r\n\r\nThe Saracen troops were coming in from the rear, and the Hospitallers\r\nwere taking the brunt of the charge. They fought like madmen, but they\r\nwere slowly being forced back.\r\n\r\nThe Master of the Hospitallers rode to the rear, to the King's standard,\r\nwhich hardly moved in the still desert air, now that the column had\r\nstopped moving.\r\n\r\nThe voice of the Duke of Burgundy came to Sir Robert's ears.\r\n\r\n\"Stand fast. The King bids you all to stand fast,\" said the duke, his\r\nvoice fading as he rode on up the column toward the knights of Poitou\r\nand the Knights Templars.\r\n\r\nThe Master of the Hospitallers was speaking in a low, urgent voice to\r\nthe King: \"My lord, we are pressed on by the enemy and in danger of\r\neternal infamy. We are losing our horses, one after the other!\"\r\n\r\n\"Good Master,\" said Richard, \"it is you who must sustain their attack.\r\nNo one can be everywhere at once.\"\r\n\r\nThe Master of the Hospitallers nodded curtly and charged back into the\r\nfray.\r\n\r\nThe King turned to Sir Baldwin de Carreo, who sat ahorse nearby, and\r\npointed toward the eastern hills. \"They will come from there, hitting us\r\nin the flank; we cannot afford to amass a rearward charge. To do so\r\nwould be to fall directly into the hands of the Saracen.\"\r\n\r\nA voice very close to Sir Robert said: \"Richard is right. If we go to\r\nthe aid of the Hospitallers, we will expose the column to a flank\r\nattack.\" It was Sir Gaeton.\r\n\r\n\"My lord the King,\" Sir Robert heard his voice say, \"is right in all but\r\none thing. If we allow the Egyptians to take us from the rear, there\r\nwill be no need for Saladin and his Turks to come down on our flank. And\r\nthe Hospitallers cannot hold for long at this rate. A charge at full\r\ngallop would break the Egyptian line and give the Hospitallers breathing\r\ntime. Are you with me?\"\r\n\r\n\"Against the orders of the King?\"\r\n\r\n\"The King cannot see everything! There are times when a man must use his\r\nown judgment! You said you were afraid of no man. Are you with me?\"\r\n\r\nAfter a moment's hesitation, Sir Gaeton couched his lance. \"I'm with\r\nyou, sir knight! Live or die, I follow! Strike and strike hard!\"\r\n\r\n\"Forward then!\" Sir Robert heard himself shouting. \"Forward for St.\r\nGeorge and for England!\"\r\n\r\n\"St. George and England!\" the Gascon echoed.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTwo great war horses began to move ponderously forward toward the battle\r\nlines, gaining momentum as they went. Moving in unison, the two knights,\r\ntheir horses now at a fast trot, lowered their lances, picking their\r\nSaracen targets with care. Larger and larger loomed the Egyptian\r\ncavalrymen as the horses changed pace to a thundering gallop.\r\n\r\nThe Egyptians tried to dodge, as they saw, too late, the approach of the\r\nChristian knights.\r\n\r\nSir Robert felt the shock against himself and his horse as the steel tip\r\nof the long ash lance struck the Saracen horseman in the chest. Out of\r\nthe corner of his eye, he saw that Sir Gaeton, too, had scored.\r\n\r\nThe Saracen, impaled on Sir Robert's lance, shot from the saddle as he\r\ndied. His lighter armor had hardly impeded the incoming spear-point, and\r\nnow his body dragged it down as he dropped toward the desert sand.\r\nAnother Moslem cavalryman was charging in now, swinging his curved\r\nsaber, taking advantage of Sir Robert's sagging lance.\r\n\r\nThere was nothing else to do but drop the lance and draw his heavy\r\nbroadsword. His hand grasped it, and it came singing from its scabbard.\r\n\r\nThe Egyptian's curved sword clanged against Sir Robert's helm, setting\r\nhis head ringing. In return, the knight's broadsword came about in a\r\nsweeping arc, and the Egyptian's horse rode on with the rider's headless\r\nbody.\r\n\r\nBehind him, Sir Robert heard further cries of \"St. George and England!\"\r\n\r\nThe Hospitallers, taking heart at the charge, were going in! Behind them\r\ncame the Count of Champagne, the Earl of Leister, and the Bishop of\r\nBeauvais, who carried a great warhammer in order that he might not break\r\nChurch Law by shedding blood.\r\n\r\nSir Robert's own sword rose and fell, cutting and hacking at the enemy.\r\nHe himself felt a dreamlike detachment, as though he were watching the\r\nbattle rather than participating in it.\r\n\r\nBut he could see that the Moslems were falling back before the Christian\r\nonslaught.\r\n\r\nAnd then, quite suddenly, there seemed to be no foeman to swing at.\r\nBreathing heavily, Sir Robert sheathed his broadsword.\r\n\r\nBeside him, Sir Gaeton did the same, saying: \"It will be a few minutes\r\nbefore they can regroup, sir knight. We may have routed them\r\ncompletely.\"\r\n\r\n\"Aye. But King Richard will not approve of my breaking ranks and\r\ndisobeying orders. I may win the battle and lose my head in the end.\"\r\n\r\n\"This is no time to worry about the future,\" said the Gascon. \"Rest for\r\na moment and relax, that you may be the stronger later. Here--have an\r\n_Old Kings_.\"\r\n\r\nHe had a pack of cigarettes in his gauntleted hand, which he profferred\r\nto Sir Robert. There were three cigarettes protruding from it, one\r\nslightly farther than the others. Sir Robert's hand reached out and took\r\nthat one.\r\n\r\n\"Thanks. When the going gets rough, I really enjoy an _Old Kings_.\"\r\n\r\nHe put one end of the cigarette in his mouth and lit the other from the\r\nlighter in Sir Gaeton's hand.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir,\" said Sir Gaeton, after lighting his own cigarette, \"_Old\r\nKings_ are the greatest. They give a man real, deep-down smoking\r\npleasure.\"\r\n\r\n\"There's no doubt about it, _Old Kings_ are a _man's_ cigarette.\" Sir\r\nRobert could feel the soothing smoke in his lungs as he inhaled deeply.\r\n\"That's great. When I want a cigarette, I don't want just _any_\r\ncigarette.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nor I,\" agreed the Gascon. \"_Old Kings_ is the only real cigarette when\r\nyou're doing a real _man's_ work.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's for sure.\" Sir Robert watched a smoke ring expand in the air.\r\n\r\nThere was a sudden clash of arms off to their left. Sir Robert dropped\r\nhis cigarette to the ground. \"The trouble is that doing a real he-man's\r\nwork doesn't always allow you to enjoy the fine, rich tobaccos of _Old\r\nKings_ right down to the very end.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, but you can always light another later,\" said the Gascon knight.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nKing Richard, on seeing his army moving suddenly toward the harassed\r\nrear, had realized the danger and had charged through the Hospitallers\r\nto get into the thick of the fray. Now the Turks were charging down from\r\nthe hills, hitting--not the flank as he had expected, but the rear!\r\nSaladin had expected him to hold fast!\r\n\r\nSir Robert and Sir Gaeton spurred their chargers toward the flapping\r\nbanner of England.\r\n\r\nThe fierce warrior-king of England, his mighty sword in hand, was\r\ncutting down Turks as though they were grain-stalks, but still the\r\nSaracen horde pressed on. More and more of the terrible Turks came\r\nboiling down out of the hills, their glittering scimitars swinging.\r\n\r\nSir Robert lost all track of time. There was nothing to do but keep his\r\nown great broadsword moving, swinging like some gigantic metronome as he\r\nhacked down the Moslem foes.\r\n\r\nAnd then, suddenly, he found himself surrounded by the Saracens! He was\r\nisolated and alone, cut off from the rest of the Christian forces! He\r\nglanced quickly around as he slashed another Saracen from pate to\r\nbreastbone. Where was Sir Gaeton? Where were the others? Where was the\r\nred-and-gold banner of Richard?\r\n\r\nHe caught a glimpse of the fluttering banner far to the rear and started\r\nto fall back.\r\n\r\nAnd then he saw another knight nearby, a huge man who swung his\r\nsparkling blade with power and force. On his steel helm gleamed a golden\r\ncoronet! Richard!\r\n\r\nAnd the great king, in spite of his prowess was outnumbered heavily and\r\nwould, within seconds, be cut down by the Saracen horde!\r\n\r\nWithout hesitation, Sir Robert plunged his horse toward the surrounded\r\nmonarch, his great blade cutting a path before him.\r\n\r\nHe saw Richard go down, falling from the saddle of his charger, but by\r\nthat time his own sword was cutting into the screaming Saracens and\r\nthey had no time to attempt any further mischief to the King. They had\r\ntheir hands full with Sir Robert de Bouain.\r\n\r\nHe did not know how long he fought there, holding his charger motionless\r\nover the inert body of the fallen king, hewing down the screaming enemy,\r\nbut presently he heard the familiar cry of \"For St. George and for\r\nEngland\" behind him. The Norman and English troops were charging in,\r\nbringing with them the banner of England!\r\n\r\nAnd then Richard was on his feet, cleaving the air about him with his\r\nown broadsword. Its bright edge, besmeared with Saracen blood, was\r\nbiting viciously into the foe.\r\n\r\nThe Turks began to fall back. Within seconds, the Christian knights were\r\nboiling around the embattled pair, forcing the Turks into retreat. And\r\nfor the second time, Sir Robert found himself with no one to fight.\r\n\r\nAnd then a voice was saying: \"You have done well this day, sir knight.\r\nRichard Plantagenet will not forget.\"\r\n\r\nSir Robert turned in his saddle to face the smiling king.\r\n\r\n\"My lord king, be assured that I would never forget my loyalty to my\r\nsovereign and liege lord. My sword and my life are yours whenever you\r\ncall.\"\r\n\r\nKing Richard's gauntleted hand grasped his own. \"If it please God, I\r\nshall never ask your life. An earldom awaits you when we return to\r\nEngland, sir knight.\"\r\n\r\nAnd then the king mounted his horse and was running full gallop after\r\nthe retreating Saracens.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nRobert took off his helmet.\r\n\r\nHe blinked for a second to adjust his eyes to the relative dimness of\r\nthe studio. After the brightness of the desert that the televicarion\r\nhelmet had projected into his eyes, the studio seemed strangely\r\ncavelike.\r\n\r\n\"How'd you like it, Bob?\" asked one of the two producers of the show.\r\n\r\nRobert Bowen nodded briskly and patted the televike helmet. \"It was\r\nO.K.,\" he said. \"Good show. A little talky at the beginning, and it\r\nneeds a better fade-out, but the action scenes were fine. The sponsor\r\nought to like it--for a while, at least.\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you mean, 'for a while'?\"\r\n\r\nRobert Bowen sighed. \"If this thing goes on the air the way it is, he'll\r\nlose sales.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why? Commercial not good enough?\"\r\n\r\n\"_Too_ good! Man, I've smoked _Old Kings_, and, believe me, the real\r\nthing never tasted as good as that cigarette did in the commercial!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's ...After a Few Words..., by Gordon Randall Garrett"

This etext was prepared from the reprint in Fantastic\r\n    Universe December 1956. Extensive research did not uncover any\r\n    evidence that the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\r\n\r\n     Publisher's Note: _The publication of this strange story by Robert\r\n     E. Howard, author of the Conan stories, so much a part of the\r\n     Living Library of Fantasy, represents a departure for this\r\n     magazine. Without abandoning our policy of bringing you, month\r\n     after month, the best in NEW Science Fiction and Fantasy, we will,\r\n     from time to time, publish material such as this, hitherto known to\r\n     only a few students of the field! GODS OF THE NORTH was published\r\n     in 1934, in Charles D. Hornig's THE FANTASY FAN, which had a\r\n     circulation of under a hundred! We thank Sam Moskowitz, Editor and\r\n     SF historian, who showed us this story._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n     She drew away from him, dwindling in the witch-fire of the skies,\r\n     until she was a figure no bigger than a child.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe clangor of the swords had died away, the shouting of the slaughter\r\nwas hushed; silence lay on the red-stained snow. The pale bleak sun that\r\nglittered so blindingly from the ice-fields and the snow-covered plains\r\nstruck sheens of silver from rent corselet and broken blade, where the\r\ndead lay in heaps. The nerveless hand yet gripped the broken hilt:\r\nhelmeted heads, back-drawn in the death throes, tilted red beards and\r\ngolden beards grimly upward, as if in last invocation to Ymir the\r\nfrost-giant.\r\n\r\nAcross the red drifts and mail-clad forms, two figures approached one\r\nanother. In that utter desolation only they moved. The frosty sky was\r\nover them, the white illimitable plain around them, the dead men at\r\ntheir feet. Slowly through the corpses they came, as ghosts might come\r\nto a tryst through the shambles of a world.\r\n\r\nTheir shields were gone, their corselets dinted. Blood smeared their\r\nmail; their swords were red. Their horned helmets showed the marks of\r\nfierce strokes.\r\n\r\nOne spoke, he whose locks and beard were red as the blood on the sunlit\r\nsnow.\r\n\r\n\"Man of the raven locks,\" said he, \"tell me your name, so that my\r\nbrothers in Vanaheim may know who was the last of Wulfhere's band to\r\nfall before the sword of Heimdul.\"\r\n\r\n\"This is my answer,\" replied the black-haired warrior: \"Not in Vanaheim,\r\nbut in Valhalla will you tell your brothers the name of Amra of\r\nAkbitana.\"\r\n\r\nHeimdul roared and sprang, and his sword swung in a mighty arc. Amra\r\nstaggered and his vision was filled with red sparks as the blade\r\nshivered into bits of blue fire on his helmet. But as he reeled he\r\nthrust with all the power of his great shoulders. The sharp point drove\r\nthrough brass scales and bones and heart, and the red-haired warrior\r\ndied at Amra's feet.\r\n\r\nAmra stood swaying, trailing his sword, a sudden sick weariness\r\nassailing him. The glare of the sun on the snow cut his eyes like a\r\nknife and the sky seemed shrunken and strangely far. He turned away from\r\nthe trampled expanse where yellow-bearded warriors lay locked with\r\nred-haired slayers in the embrace of death. A few steps he took, and the\r\nglare of the snow fields was suddenly dimmed. A rushing wave of\r\nblindness engulfed him, and he sank down into the snow, supporting\r\nhimself on one mailed arm, seeking to shake the blindness out of his\r\neyes as a lion might shake his mane.\r\n\r\nA silvery laugh cut through his dizziness, and his sight cleared slowly.\r\nThere was a strangeness about all the landscape that he could not place\r\nor define--an unfamiliar tinge to earth and sky. But he did not think\r\nlong of this. Before him, swaying like a sapling in the wind, stood a\r\nwoman. Her body was like ivory, and save for a veil of gossamer, she was\r\nnaked as the day. Her slender bare feet were whiter than the snow they\r\nspurned. She laughed, and her laughter was sweeter than the rippling of\r\nsilvery fountains, and poisonous with cruel mockery.\r\n\r\n\"Who are you?\" demanded the warrior.\r\n\r\n\"What matter?\" Her voice was more musical than a silver-stringed harp,\r\nbut it was edged with cruelty.\r\n\r\n\"Call up your men,\" he growled, grasping his sword. \"Though my strength\r\nfail me, yet they shall not take me alive. I see that you are of the\r\nVanir.\"\r\n\r\n\"Have I said so?\"\r\n\r\nHe looked again at her unruly locks, which he had thought to be red. Now\r\nhe saw that they were neither red nor yellow, but a glorious compound\r\nof both colors. He gazed spell-bound. Her hair was like elfin-gold,\r\nstriking which, the sun dazzled him. Her eyes were neither wholly blue\r\nnor wholly grey, but of shifting colors and dancing lights and clouds of\r\ncolors he could not recognize. Her full red lips smiled, and from her\r\nslim feet to the blinding crown of her billowy hair, her ivory body was\r\nas perfect as the dream of a god. Amra's pulse hammered in his temples.\r\n\r\n\"I can not tell,\" said he, \"whether you are of Vanaheim and mine enemy,\r\nor of Asgard and my friend. Far have I wandered, from Zingara to the Sea\r\nof Vilayet, in Stygia and Kush, and the country of the Hyrkanians; but a\r\nwoman like you I have never seen. Your locks blind me with their\r\nbrightness. Not even among the fairest daughters of the Aesir have I\r\nseen such hair, by Ymir!\"\r\n\r\n\"Who are you to swear by Ymir?\" she mocked. \"What know you of the gods\r\nof ice and snow, you who have come up from the south to adventure among\r\nstrangers?\"\r\n\r\n\"By the dark gods of my own race!\" he cried in anger. \"Have I been\r\nbackward in the sword-play, stranger or no? This day I have seen four\r\nscore warriors fall, and I alone survive the field where Mulfhere's\r\nreavers met the men of Bragi. Tell me, woman, have you caught the flash\r\nof mail across the snow-plains, or seen armed men moving upon the ice?\"\r\n\r\n\"I have seen the hoar-frost glittering in the sun,\" she answered. \"I\r\nhave heard the wind whispering across the everlasting snows.\"\r\n\r\nHe shook his head.\r\n\r\n\"Niord should have come up with us before the battle joined. I fear he\r\nand his warriors have been ambushed. Wulfhere lies dead with all his\r\nweapon-men.\r\n\r\n\"I had thought there was no village within many leagues of this spot,\r\nfor the war carried us far, but you can have come no great distance over\r\nthese snows, naked as you are. Lead me to your tribe, if you are of\r\nAsgard, for I am faint with the weariness of strife.\"\r\n\r\n\"My dwelling place is further than you can walk, Amra of Akbitana!\" she\r\nlaughed. Spreading wide her arms she swayed before him, her golden head\r\nlolling wantonly, her scintillant eyes shadowed beneath long silken\r\nlashes. \"Am I not beautiful, man?\"\r\n\r\n\"Like Dawn running naked on the snows,\" he muttered, his eyes burning\r\nlike those of a wolf.\r\n\r\n\"Then why do you not rise and follow me? Who is the strong warrior who\r\nfalls down before me?\" she chanted in maddening mockery. \"Lie down and\r\ndie in the snow with the other fools, Amra of the black hair. You can\r\nnot follow where I would lead.\"\r\n\r\nWith an oath the man heaved himself upon his feet, his blue eyes blazing\r\nhis dark scarred face convulsed. Rage shook his soul, but desire for the\r\ntaunting figure before him hammered at his temples and drove his wild\r\nblood riotously through his veins. Passion fierce as physical agony\r\nflooded his whole being so that earth and sky swam red to his dizzy\r\ngaze, and weariness and faintness were swept from him in madness.\r\n\r\nHe spoke no word as he drove at her fingers hooked like talons. With a\r\nshriek of laughter she leaped back and ran, laughing at him over her\r\nwhite shoulder. With a low growl Amra followed. He had forgotten the\r\nfight, forgotten the mailed warriors who lay in their blood, forgotten\r\nNiord's belated reavers. He had thought only for the slender white shape\r\nwhich seemed to float rather than run before him.\r\n\r\nOut across the white blinding plain she led him. The trampled red field\r\nfell out of sight behind him, but still Amra kept on with the silent\r\ntenacity of his race. His mailed feet broke through the frozen crust; he\r\nsank deep in the drifts and forged through them by sheer strength. But\r\nthe girl danced across the snow as light as a feather floating across a\r\npool; her naked feet scarcely left their imprint on the hoar-frost. In\r\nspite of the fire in his veins, the cold bit through the warrior's mail\r\nand furs; but the girl in her gossamer veil ran as lightly and as gaily\r\nas if she danced through the palms and rose gardens of Poitain.\r\n\r\nBlack curses drooled through the warrior's parched lips. The great veins\r\nswelled and throbbed in his temples, and his teeth gnashed\r\nspasmodically.\r\n\r\n\"You can not escape me!\" he roared. \"Lead me into a trap and I'll pile\r\nthe heads of your kinsmen at your feet. Hide from me and I'll tear apart\r\nthe mountains to find you! I'll follow you to hell and beyond hell!\"\r\n\r\nHer maddening laughter floated back to him, and foam flew from the\r\nwarrior's lips. Further and further into the wastes she led him, till he\r\nsaw the wide plains give way to low hills, marching upward in broken\r\nranges. Far to the north he caught a glimpse of towering mountains, blue\r\nwith the distance, or white with the eternal snows. Above these\r\nmountains shone the flaring rays of the borealis. They spread fan-wise\r\ninto the sky, frosty blades of cold flaming light, changing in color,\r\ngrowing and brightening.\r\n\r\nAbove him the skies glowed and crackled with strange lights and gleams.\r\nThe snow shone weirdly, now frosty blue, now icy crimson, now cold\r\nsilver. Through a shimmering icy realm of enchantment Amra plunged\r\ndoggedly onward, in a crystaline maze where the only reality was the\r\nwhite body dancing across the glittering snow beyond his reach--ever\r\nbeyond his reach.\r\n\r\nYet he did not wonder at the necromantic strangeness of it all, not even\r\nwhen two gigantic figures rose up to bar his way. The scales of their\r\nmail were white with hoar-frost; their helmets and their axes were\r\nsheathed in ice. Snow sprinkled their locks; in their beards were spikes\r\nof icicles; their eyes were cold as the lights that streamed above them.\r\n\r\n\"Brothers!\" cried the girl, dancing between them. \"Look who follows! I\r\nhave brought you a man for the feasting! Take his heart that we may lay\r\nit smoking on our father's board!\"\r\n\r\nThe giants answered with roars like the grinding of ice-bergs on a\r\nfrozen shore, and heaved up their shining axes as the maddened Akbitanan\r\nhurled himself upon them. A frosty blade flashed before his eyes,\r\nblinding him with its brightness, and he gave back a terrible stroke\r\nthat sheared through his foe's thigh. With a groan the victim fell, and\r\nat the instant Amra was dashed into the snow, his left shoulder numb\r\nfrom the blow of the survivor, from which the warrior's mail had barely\r\nsaved his life. Amra saw the remaining giant looming above him like a\r\ncolossus carved of ice, etched against the glowing sky. The axe fell, to\r\nsink through the snow and deep into the frozen earth as Amra hurled\r\nhimself aside and leaped to his feet. The giant roared and wrenched the\r\naxe-head free, but even as he did so, Amra's sword sang down. The\r\ngiant's knees bent and he sank slowly into the snow which turned crimson\r\nwith the blood that gushed from his half-severed neck.\r\n\r\nAmra wheeled, to see the girl standing a short distance away, staring in\r\nwide-eyed horror, all mockery gone from her face. He cried out fiercely\r\nand the blood-drops flew from his sword as his hand shook in the\r\nintensity of his passion.\r\n\r\n\"Call the rest of your brothers!\" he roared. \"Call the dogs! I'll give\r\ntheir hearts to the wolves!\"\r\n\r\nWith a cry of fright she turned and fled. She did not laugh now, nor\r\nmock him over her shoulder. She ran as for her life, and though he\r\nstrained every nerve and thew, until his temples were like to burst and\r\nthe snow swam red to his gaze, she drew away from him, dwindling in the\r\nwitch-fire of the skies, until she was a figure no bigger than a child,\r\nthen a dancing white flame on the snow, then a dim blur in the\r\ndistance. But grinding his teeth until the blood started from his gums,\r\nhe reeled on, and he saw the blur grow to a dancing white flame, and\r\nthen she was running less than a hundred paces ahead of him, and slowly\r\nthe space narrowed, foot by foot.\r\n\r\nShe was running with effort now, her golden locks blowing free; he heard\r\nthe quick panting of her breath, and saw a flash of fear in the look she\r\ncast over her alabaster shoulder. The grim endurance of the warrior had\r\nserved him well. The speed ebbed from her flashing white legs; she\r\nreeled in her gait. In his untamed soul flamed up the fires of hell she\r\nhad fanned so well. With an inhuman roar he closed in on her, just as\r\nshe wheeled with a haunting cry and flung out her arms to fend him off.\r\n\r\nHis sword fell into the snow as he crushed her to him. Her supple body\r\nbent backward as she fought with desperate frenzy in his iron arms. Her\r\ngolden hair blew about his face, blinding him with its sheen; the feel\r\nof her slender figure twisting in his mailed arms drove him to blinder\r\nmadness. His strong fingers sank deep into her smooth flesh, and that\r\nflesh was cold as ice. It was as if he embraced not a woman of human\r\nflesh and blood, but a woman of flaming ice. She writhed her golden head\r\naside, striving to avoid the savage kisses that bruised her red lips.\r\n\r\n\"You are cold as the snows,\" he mumbled dazedly. \"I will warm you with\r\nthe fire in my own blood--\"\r\n\r\nWith a desperate wrench she twisted from his arms, leaving her single\r\ngossamer garment in his grasp. She sprang back and faced him, her golden\r\nlocks in wild disarray, her white bosom heaving, her beautiful eyes\r\nblazing with terror. For an instant he stood frozen, awed by her\r\nterrible beauty as she posed naked against the snows.\r\n\r\nAnd in that instant she flung her arms toward the lights that glowed in\r\nthe skies above her and cried out in a voice that rang in Amra's ears\r\nfor ever after:\r\n\r\n\"_Ymir! Oh, my father, save me!_\"\r\n\r\nAmra was leaping forward, arms spread to seize her, when with a crack\r\nlike the breaking of an ice mountain, the whole skies leaped into icy\r\nfire. The girl's ivory body was suddenly enveloped in a cold blue flame\r\nso blinding that the warrior threw up his hands to shield his eyes. A\r\nfleeting instant, skies and snowy hills were bathed in crackling white\r\nflames, blue darts of icy light, and frozen crimson fires. Then Amra\r\nstaggered and cried out. The girl was gone. The glowing snow lay empty\r\nand bare; high above him the witch-lights flashed and played in a\r\nfrosty sky gone mad and among the distant blue mountains there sounded a\r\nrolling thunder as of a gigantic war-chariot rushing behind steeds whose\r\nfrantic hoofs struck lightning from the snows and echoes from the skies.\r\n\r\nThen suddenly the borealis, the snowy hills and the blazing heavens\r\nreeled drunkenly to Amra's sight; thousands of fireballs burst with\r\nshowers of sparks, and the sky itself became a titanic wheel which\r\nrained stars as it spun. Under his feet the snowy hills heaved up like a\r\nwave, and the Akbitanan crumpled into the snows to lie motionless.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn a cold dark universe, whose sun was extinguished eons ago, Amra felt\r\nthe movement of life, alien and un-guessed. An earthquake had him in its\r\ngrip and was shaking him to and fro, at the same time chafing his hands\r\nand feet until he yelled in pain and fury and groped for his sword.\r\n\r\n\"He's coming to, Horsa,\" grunted a voice. \"Haste--we must rub the frost\r\nout of his limbs, if he's ever to wield sword again.\"\r\n\r\n\"He won't open his left hand,\" growled another, his voice indicating\r\nmuscular strain. \"He's clutching something--\"\r\n\r\nAmra opened his eyes and stared into the bearded faces that bent over\r\nhim. He was surrounded by tall golden-haired warriors in mail and furs.\r\n\r\n\"Amra! You live!\"\r\n\r\n\"By Crom, Niord,\" gasped he, \"am I alive, or are we all dead and in\r\nValhalla?\"\r\n\r\n\"We live,\" grunted the Aesir, busy over Amra's half-frozen feet. \"We had\r\nto fight our way through an ambush, else we had come up with you before\r\nthe battle was joined. The corpses were scarce cold when we came upon\r\nthe field. We did not find you among the dead, so we followed your\r\nspoor. In Ymir's name, Amra, why did you wander off into the wastes of\r\nthe north? We have followed your tracks in the snow for hours. Had a\r\nblizzard come up and hidden them, we had never found you, by Ymir!\"\r\n\r\n\"Swear not so often by Ymir,\" muttered a warrior, glancing at the\r\ndistant mountains. \"This is his land and the god bides among yonder\r\nmountains, the legends say.\"\r\n\r\n\"I followed a woman,\" Amra answered hazily. \"We met Bragi's men in the\r\nplains. I know not how long we fought. I alone lived. I was dizzy and\r\nfaint. The land lay like a dream before me. Only now do all things seem\r\nnatural and familiar. The woman came and taunted me. She was beautiful\r\nas a frozen flame from hell. When I looked at her I was as one mad, and\r\nforgot all else in the world. I followed her. Did you not find her\r\ntracks. Or the giants in icy mail I slew?\"\r\n\r\nNiord shook his head.\r\n\r\n\"We found only your tracks in the snow, Amra.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then it may be I was mad,\" said Amra dazedly. \"Yet you yourself are no\r\nmore real to me than was the golden haired witch who fled naked across\r\nthe snows before me. Yet from my very hands she vanished in icy flame.\"\r\n\r\n\"He is delirious,\" whispered a warrior.\r\n\r\n\"Not so!\" cried an older man, whose eyes were wild and weird. \"It was\r\nAtali, the daughter of Ymir, the frost-giant! To fields of the dead she\r\ncomes, and shows herself to the dying! Myself when a boy I saw her, when\r\nI lay half-slain on the bloody field of Wolraven. I saw her walk among\r\nthe dead in the snows, her naked body gleaming like ivory and her golden\r\nhair like a blinding flame in the moonlight. I lay and howled like a\r\ndying dog because I could not crawl after her. She lures men from\r\nstricken fields into the wastelands to be slain by her brothers, the\r\nice-giants, who lay men's red hearts smoking on Ymir's board. Amra has\r\nseen Atali, the frost-giant's daughter!\"\r\n\r\n\"Bah!\" grunted Horsa. \"Old Gorm's mind was turned in his youth by a\r\nsword cut on the head. Amra was delirious with the fury of battle. Look\r\nhow his helmet is dinted. Any of those blows might have addled his\r\nbrain. It was an hallucination he followed into the wastes. He is from\r\nthe south; what does he know of Atali?\"\r\n\r\n\"You speak truth, perhaps,\" muttered Amra. \"It was all strange and\r\nweird--by Crom!\"\r\n\r\nHe broke off, glaring at the object that still dangled from his clenched\r\nleft fist; the others gaped silently at the veil he held up--a wisp of\r\ngossamer that was never spun by human distaff."

Of special interest to the legally\r\ninclined student is the famous Skrrgck Affair, which began before the\r\nGalactic Tribunal with the case of _Citizens vs. Skrrgck_.\r\n\r\nThe case, and the opinion of the Court, may be summarized as follows:\r\n\r\nSkrrgck, a native of Sknnbt (Altair IV), where theft is honorable,\r\nsanctioned by law and custom, immigrated to Earth (Sol III) where\r\ntheft is contrary to both law and custom.\r\n\r\nWhile residing in Chicago, a city in a political subdivision known as\r\nthe State of Illinois, part of the United States of America, one of\r\nthe ancient nation-states of Earth, he overheard his landlady use the\r\nphrase \"A license to steal,\" a common colloquialism in the area, which\r\nrefers to any special privilege.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 1: Actual scene of license issue (Skrrgck\r\nsuperimposed)]\r\n\r\nSkrrgck then went to a police station in Chicago and requested a\r\nlicense to steal. The desk sergeant, as a joke, wrote out a document\r\npurporting to be a license to steal, and Skrrgck, relying on said\r\ndocument, committed theft, was apprehended, tried and convicted. On\r\ndirect appeal allowed to the Galactic Tribunal, the Court held:\r\n\r\n(1) All persons are required to know and obey the law of the\r\njurisdiction in which they reside.\r\n\r\n(2) Public officials must refrain from misrepresenting to strangers the\r\nlaw of the jurisdiction.\r\n\r\n(3) Where, as here, a public official is guilty of such\r\nmisrepresentation, the requirement of knowledge no longer applies.\r\n\r\n(4) Where, as here, it is shown by uncontradicted evidence that a\r\ndefendant is law-abiding and willing to comply with the standards of\r\nhis place of residence, misrepresentation of law by public officials\r\nmay amount to entrapment.\r\n\r\n(5) The Doctrine of Entrapment bars the State of Illinois from\r\nprosecuting this defendant.\r\n\r\n(6) The magnitude of the crime is unimportant compared with the\r\nprinciple involved, and the fact that the defendant's unusual training\r\non Sknnbt enabled him to steal a large building in Chicago, known as\r\nthe Merchandise Mart, is of no significance.\r\n\r\n(7) The defendant, however, was civilly liable for the return of the\r\nbuilding, and its occupants, or their value, even if he had to steal\r\nto get it, provided, however, that he stole only on and from a planet\r\nwhere theft was legal.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 2: The moment of decision, case of _Citizens vs.\r\nSkrrgck_]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Skrrgck case was by no means concluded by the decision of the\r\nGalactic Tribunal, but continued to reverberate down the years, a field\r\nday for lawyers, and \"a lesson to all in the complexities of modern\r\nintergalactic law and society,\" said Winston, Harold C, Herman Prof, of\r\nLegal History, Harvard.\r\n\r\nThough freed on the criminal charge of theft, Skrrgck still faced some\r\n20,000 charges of kidnapping, plus the civil liability imposed upon him\r\nby the ruling of the Court.\r\n\r\nThe kidnapping charges were temporarily held in abeyance. Not that the\r\nabductions were not considered outrageous, but it was quickly realized\r\nby all concerned that if Skrrgck were constantly involved in lengthy\r\nand expensive defenses to criminal prosecutions, there would be no\r\nchance at all of obtaining any restitution from him. First things\r\nfirst, and with Terrans that rarely means justice.\r\n\r\nSkrrgck offered to pay over the money he had received for the building\r\nand its occupants, but that was unacceptable to the Terrans, for what\r\nthey really wanted, with that exaggerated fervor typical of them,\r\nprovided it agrees with their financial interests, was the return of\r\nthe original articles. Not only were the people wanted back, but the\r\nbuilding itself had a special significance.\r\n\r\nIts full title was \"The New Merchandise Mart\" and it had been built\r\nin the exact style of the original and on the exact spot on the south\r\nside of the Chicago River where the original had stood prior to its\r\ndestruction in the Sack of Chicago. It was more than just a large\r\ncommercial structure to the Terrans. It was also a symbol of Terra's\r\nunusually quick recovery from its Empire Chaos into its present\r\nposition of leadership within the Galactic Union. The Terrans wanted\r\nthat building back.\r\n\r\nSo Skrrgck, an obliging fellow at heart, tried first to get it back,\r\nbut this proved impossible, for he had sold the building to the\r\nAldebaranian Confederacy for use in its annual \"prosperity fiesta.\"\r\n\r\nThe dominant culture of the Aldebaranian system is a descendant of the\r\n\"conspicuous destruction\" or \"potlatch\" type, in which articles of\r\nvalue are destroyed to prove the wealth and power of the destroyers.\r\nIt was customary once every Aldebaranian year--about six Terran--for\r\nthe Aldebaranian government to sponsor a token celebration of this\r\ndestructive sort, and it had purchased the Merchandise Mart from\r\nSkrrgck as part of its special celebration marking the first thousand\r\nyears of the Confederacy.\r\n\r\nConsequently, the building, along with everything else, was totally\r\ndestroyed in the \"bonfire\" that consumed the entire fourth planet from\r\nthe main Aldebaranian sun.\r\n\r\nNor was Skrrgck able to arrange the return to Terra of the occupants of\r\nthe building, some 20,000 in number, because he had sold them as slaves\r\nto the Boötean League.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt is commonly thought slavery is forbidden throughout the Galaxy by\r\nthe terms of Article 19 of the Galactic Compact, but such is not the\r\ncase. What is actually forbidden is \"involuntary servitude\" and this\r\nsituation proved the significance of that distinction. In the case of\r\n_Sol v. Boötes_, the Galactic Tribunal held that Terra had no right to\r\nforce the \"slaves\" to give up their slavery and return to Terra if they\r\ndid not wish to. And, quite naturally, none of them wished to.\r\n\r\nIt will be remembered that the Boöteans, a singularly handsome and\r\ngood-natured people, were in imminent danger of racial extinction due\r\nto the disastrous effects of a strange nucleonic storm which had passed\r\nthrough their system in 1622. The physiological details of the \"Boötean\r\nEffect,\" as it has been called, was to render every Boötean sterile in\r\nrelation to every other Boötean, while leaving each Boötean normally\r\ncapable of reproduction, provided one of the partners in the union had\r\nnot been subjected to the nucleonic storm.\r\n\r\nFaced with this situation, the Boöteans immediately took steps to\r\nencourage widespread immigration by other humanoid races, chiefly\r\nTerrans, for it was Terrans who had originally colonized Boötes and it\r\nwas therefore known that interbreeding was possible.\r\n\r\nBut the Boöteans were largely unsuccessful in their immigration\r\npolicy. Terra was peaceful and prosperous, and the Boöteans, being\r\npoor advertisers, were unable to convince more than a handful to leave\r\nthe relative comforts of home for the far-off Boötean system where,\r\nalmost all were sure, some horrible fate lay behind the Boöteans'\r\nhoneyed words. So when Skrrgck showed up with some 20,000 Terrans,\r\nthe Boöteans, in desperation, agreed to purchase them in the hope of\r\navoiding the \"involuntary servitude\" prohibition of Article 19 by\r\nmaking them like it.\r\n\r\nIn this, they were spectacularly successful. The \"slaves\" were\r\ntreated to the utmost luxury and every effort was made to satisfy any\r\nreasonable wish. Their \"duties\" consisted entirely of \"keeping company\"\r\nwith the singularly attractive Boöteans.\r\n\r\nUnder these circumstances it is, perhaps, hardly surprising that out of\r\nthe 20,101 occupants, all but 332 flatly refused to return to Terra.\r\n\r\nThe 332 who did wish to return, most of whom were borderline\r\npsychotics, were shipped home, and Boötes sued Skrrgck for their\r\npurchase price, but was turned down by the Galactic Quadrant Court on\r\nthe theory of, basically, Caveat Emptor--let the buyer beware.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Court in _Sol v. Boötes_ had held that although adults could not be\r\nrequired to return to Terra, minors under the age of 31 could be, and\r\nan additional 569 were returned under this ruling, to the vociferous\r\ndisgust of the post-puberty members of that group. Since there was\r\napparently some question of certain misrepresentations by Skrrgck\r\nas to the ages or family affiliations of some members of this minor\r\ngroup, he agreed to an out-of-court settlement of Boötes' claim for\r\ntheir purchase price, thus depriving the legal profession of further\r\nclarification of the rights of two \"good faith\" dealers in this\r\npeculiar sort of transaction.\r\n\r\nThe Terran people, of course, were totally unsatisfied with this\r\nresult. Led by some demagogues and, to a milder degree, by most of the\r\npolitical opposition to the existing Terran government, and reminded of\r\ncertain actual examples from Terra's own history, many became convinced\r\nthat some form of nefarious \"brainwashing\" had been exercised upon the\r\n\"unfortunate\" Terran expatriates. Excitement ran high, and there was\r\neven some agitation for withdrawal from the Galactic Union.\r\n\r\nConfronted with such unrest, the Terran government made efforts to\r\nreach some settlement with Boötes despite the decision of the Court\r\nin _Sol v. Boötes_, and was finally able to gain in the Centaurian\r\nAgreement a substantial reparation, it being specifically stipulated\r\nin the Agreement that the money was to be paid to the dependents who\r\nsuffered actual financial loss.\r\n\r\nIn a suit against the Terran government by one of the excluded\r\nfamilies, to obtain for that family a share of the reparation, the\r\nvalidity of the treaty, as it applied to exclude the suing family and\r\nothers in like position, was upheld by the United States Supreme Court.\r\n\r\nThe suit was begun before the Agreement had been ratified by the\r\nGeneral Assembly, and the Court indicated that the plaintiff would\r\nhave lost on the strength of a long line of cases giving the World\r\nPresident certain inherent powers over the conduct of foreign affairs.\r\nSince, however, the matter came up for decision after ratification,\r\nthe Court said that the \"inherent powers\" question was moot, and that\r\nthe Agreement, having been elevated to the status of a treaty by\r\nratification, must be held valid under the \"Supremacy of Treaties\"\r\nsection of Article 102 of the United Terran Charter.\r\n\r\nAlthough this failed to satisfy the Terran people--and their anger may\r\nhave contributed to the fall of the Solarian Party administration in\r\nthe following election--the Treaty is generally considered by students\r\nof the subject as a triumph of Solarian diplomacy, and an outstanding\r\nexample of intergalactic good faith on the part of Boötes.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOf course, neither the demagogy nor the anger could hide forever the\r\ntrue facts about how the Boöteans were treating their \"slaves,\" and\r\nwhen the true facts became known, there was a sudden flood of migration\r\nfrom Terra to Boötes, which threatened to depopulate the Solarian\r\nEmpire and drown Boötes. The flood was quickly dammed by the Treaty\r\nof Deneb restricting migration between the two systems. This treaty\r\nwas held to be a valid police-powers exception to the \"Free Migration\"\r\nprinciple of Article 17 of the Galactic Compact in _Boleslaw v. Sol and\r\nBoötes_.\r\n\r\nAll this left Skrrgck with liabilities of some forty million credits\r\nand practically no assets. Like most Altairians, he was a superb thief\r\nbut a poor trader. The price he had received for the Merchandise Mart\r\nand the \"slaves,\" while amounting to a tidy personal fortune, was\r\nless than half the amount of the claims against him, and due to an\r\nunfortunate predilection for slow _Aedrils_ and fast _Flowezies_, he\r\nonly had about half of that left.\r\n\r\nSkrrgck, who had by this time apparently developed a love of litigation\r\nequal to his love of thievery, used part of what he did have left in a\r\nlast effort to evade liability by going into bankruptcy, a move which\r\nwas naturally met with howls of outrage by his creditors and a flood\r\nof objections to his petition, a flood which very nearly drowned the\r\nFederal District Court in Chicago.\r\n\r\nIt would be difficult to imagine a more complex legal battle than might\r\nhave taken place, nor one more instructive to the legal profession, had\r\nthe situation been carried to its logical conclusion.\r\n\r\nOn the one hand was the age-old policy of both Terran and Galactic\r\nbankruptcy law. A man becomes unable to pay his debts. He goes into\r\nbankruptcy. Whatever he does have is distributed to his creditors, who\r\nmust be satisfied with what they can get out of his present assets.\r\nThey cannot require him to go to work to earn additional funds with\r\nwhich to pay them more. It is precisely to escape this form of mortgage\r\non one's future that bankruptcy exists.\r\n\r\nYet here were over seven thousand creditors claiming that Skrrgck's\r\ndebts should not be discharged in bankruptcy, because Skrrgck could be\r\nrequired to steal enough to satisfy them fully.\r\n\r\nCould the creditors require Skrrgck to exert such personal efforts to\r\nsatisfy their claims? A lawyer would almost certainly say \"no,\" citing\r\nthe Bankruptcy Act as sufficient grounds alone, not to mention the\r\nanomaly of having Terrans, in a Terran court, ask that Skrrgck, for\r\ntheir benefit, commit an act illegal on Terra and punishable by that\r\nTerran court.\r\n\r\nThe idea of a Terran court giving judicial sanction to theft is novel,\r\nto say the least. Indeed, Judge Griffin, who was presiding, was\r\noverheard to remark to a friend on the golf course that he \"would throw\r\nthe whole d--n thing out\" for that reason alone.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nYet, in spite of this undeniable weight of opinion, it is difficult to\r\nsay just what the final decision would have been had the matter been\r\ncarried to the Galactic Tribunal, for in the original case of _Skrrgck\r\nv. Illinois_, that august body, it will be remembered, had specifically\r\nstated that Skrrgck was liable for the value of the building and its\r\noccupants, \"even if he must steal to obtain it.\"\r\n\r\nNow that hasty and ill-advised phrase was certainly dicta, and was\r\nprobably intended only as a joke, the opinion having been written by\r\nMaster Adjudicator Stsssts, a member of that irrepressible race of\r\nsaurian humorists, the Sirians. But if the case had actually come\r\nbefore them, the Court might have been hoist on its own petard, so to\r\nspeak, and been forced to rule in accord with its earlier \"joke.\"\r\n\r\nUnfortunately for the curiosity of the legal profession, the question\r\nwas never to be answered, for Skrrgck did a remarkable thing which\r\nmade the whole controversy irrelevant. What his motives were will\r\nprobably never be known. His character makes it unlikely that he began\r\nthe bankruptcy proceedings in good faith and was later moved by\r\nconscience. It is possible that the bankruptcy was merely an elaborate\r\npiece of misdirection. More probably, however, he simply seized on the\r\nunusual opportunity the publicity gave him.\r\n\r\nWhatever the motives, the facts are that Skrrgck used the last of\r\nhis waning resources to purchase one of the newly developed Terran\r\nMotors' \"Timebirds\" in which he traveled secretly to Altair. Even\r\nthis first model of the Timebird, with its primitive meson exchange\r\ndiscoordinator, cut the trip from Sol to Altair from weeks to days,\r\nand Skrrgck, landing secretly on his home planet while his bankruptcy\r\naction was still in the turmoil stage, was able to accomplish the\r\ngreatest \"coup\" in Altairian history. He never could have done it\r\nwithout the publicity of the legal proceedings. In a culture where\r\ntheft is honorable, the most stringent precautions are taken against\r\nits accomplishment, but who could have expected Skrrgck? He was\r\nlight-years away, trying to go into bankruptcy.\r\n\r\nAnd so, while all eyes on Altair, as well as throughout the rest of the\r\nGalaxy, were amusedly fixed on the legal circus shaping up on Terra,\r\nSkrrgck was able to steal the Altairian Crown Jewels, and the Altairian\r\nCrown Prince as well, and flee with them to Sol.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe reaction was violent. The Galaxy was gripped by an almost\r\nhysterical amusement. Skrrgck's creditors on Terra were overjoyed. The\r\nAltairians made one effort to regain their valuables in the courts, but\r\nwere promptly turned down by the Galactic Tribunal which held, wisely,\r\nthat a society which made a virtue of theft would have to take the\r\nconsequences of its own culture.\r\n\r\nSo Skrrgck's creditors were paid in full. The jewels alone were more\r\nthan sufficient for that, containing as they did no less than seven\r\npriceless \"Wanderstones,\" those strange bits of frozen fire found ever\r\nso rarely floating in the interstellar voids, utterly impervious to\r\nany of the effects of gravitation. Altair paid a fantastic price for\r\nthe return of the collection, and Skrrgck also demanded, and got, a\r\nsizable ransom for the Prince, after threatening to sell him to Boötes,\r\nfrom whence, of course, he would never return. Being a prince in a\r\ndemocratic, constitutional monarchy is not as glamorous as you might\r\nthink.\r\n\r\nHis creditors satisfied, Skrrgck returned to Sknnbt, dragging with\r\nhim an angry Crown Prince--angry at having lost the chance to go to\r\nBoötes, that is. At Altair, Skrrgck was received as a popular hero.\r\nHe had accomplished something of which every Altairian had dreamed,\r\nalmost from the moment of his birth, and he was widely and joyously\r\nacclaimed. Riding on this wave of popular adulation, he entered\r\npolitics, ran for the office of Premier, and was elected by an\r\noverwhelming majority.\r\n\r\nAs soon as he took office, he took steps, in accordance with Altairian\r\ncustom, to wipe out the \"stain\" on his honor incurred by allowing the\r\nChicago police sergeant to fool him with the now famous License to\r\nSteal.\r\n\r\nHe instituted suit against the sergeant for the expenses of his defense\r\nto the original theft charge.\r\n\r\nThe case was carried all the way to the Galactic Tribunal, which by\r\nthis time was heartily sick of the whole mess. Feeling apparently that\r\nthe sergeant was the original cause of said mess, the Court overruled\r\nhis plea that he had merely been joking.\r\n\r\nThe Court cited an ancient case from West Virginia, U.S.A.--_Plate v.\r\nDurst_, 42 W. Va. 63, 24 SE 580, 32 L.R.A. 404. (Note: The date of this\r\ncase is invariably given as 1896, which is most confusing, since the\r\npresent date is only 1691. The 1896, however, refers to the eighteen\r\nhundred and ninety-sixth year of the pre-atomic era, which we, of\r\ncourse, style A.A.--Ante Atomica. Since the present era begins with the\r\nfirst atomic explosion, the case actually occurred in approximately the\r\nyear 54 A.A.)\r\n\r\nThe Court quoted the opinion in this ancient case as follows: \"Jokes\r\nare sometimes taken seriously by ... the inexperienced ... and if such\r\nis the case, and the person thereby deceived is led to (incur expenses)\r\nin the full belief and expectation that the joker is in earnest, the\r\nlaw will also take the joker at his word, and give him good reason to\r\nsmile.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAccordingly, the sergeant was charged with a very large judgment.\r\nAlthough the City of Chicago paid this judgment, the sergeant had\r\nbecome the laughing-stock of the planet, so he applied for, and was\r\ngranted, a hardship exception to the Treaty of Deneb and migrated to\r\nBoötes.\r\n\r\nThere, regarded as the real savior of the Boötean race, and a chosen\r\ninstrument of the God of Boötes, he was received as a saint. He died in\r\n1689, surrounded by his 22 children and 47 grandchildren, having made\r\nhimself wealthy by becoming the leader of a most excessive fertility\r\ncult, which is only now being forcibly suppressed by the Boötean\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\nIn 1635 P.A., someone on Earth remembered the kidnapping indictments\r\nstill outstanding against Skrrgck and attempted to prosecute them. By\r\nthis time, however, Skrrgck was Premier, the chief executive officer of\r\nAltair, and all extradition matters were within his sole discretion. In\r\nthe exercise of this power, he refused to extradite himself, and the\r\nprosecutor on Earth, whose constituents were beginning to laugh at him,\r\nhad the indictments quashed \"in the interest of interstellar harmony.\"\r\n\r\nThe story has an interesting sequel. During Skrrgck's unprecedented six\r\nconsecutive terms as Premier (no one else had ever served less than\r\nseven), he was able, by dint of unremitting political maneuvering,\r\nto have theft outlawed in the Altairian system. It was, he said, \"a\r\ncultural trait that is more trouble than it is worth.\""

L. M. STOLTZ, STANFORD UNIVERSITY\r\n\r\n           [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\r\n             Worlds of If Science Fiction, February 1957.\r\n         Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\r\n         the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Minister of Peace asked the United States President if he had heard\r\nfrom the Secretary of State. \"Yes,\" the President said. \"I heard from\r\nMr. Thompson only a few minutes ago.\"\r\n\r\n\"How's their final conference coming, Mr. President?\"\r\n\r\n\"Inevitably. Operation Push Button within the hour.\"\r\n\r\nThe Minister of Peace blinked out the window at Washington, D.C. \"So\r\nthey're going to blow up the world?\"\r\n\r\n\"Inevitably.\"\r\n\r\n\"Shall we watch it?\" asked the Minister of Peace.\r\n\r\nThe President nodded, spoke to master control through the intercom\r\nbox on his desk, and switched on the TV screen. They had a special\r\npipe-line into the United Nations Cellar. They sat back, had martinis,\r\nand watched the interior of the Cellar come to life on the screen.\r\n\r\nThree thousand miles from New Washington, under a natural camouflage of\r\ntundra and wintry hills, the U.N. Cellar was thought by its occupants\r\nto be thoroughly resistant to any offensive weapons. It was three miles\r\nunderground, protected by lead, concrete and steel. Its location was\r\nknown only to the U.N. Security Division that was supposed to be\r\nstrictly neutral in international affairs, or so the Cellar occupants\r\nassumed. The engineers and workmen who had planned and constructed the\r\nCellar were supposed to have been brain-washed and therefore had no\r\nmemory of the great project. An occasional caribou drifted over the\r\nCellar with the North Wind, and wolves that always follow the caribou.\r\n\r\nIn his suite, Chandler Thompson, Secretary of State, prepared himself\r\nfor the global diplomacy game's final hand in which it is never so\r\nimportant what hand you play, as the way you play it. After years of\r\nnegotiation, full agreement on Operation Push Button had been attained,\r\nand Thompson took some pride in having played a leading role in the\r\ningenious idea.\r\n\r\nMorten, his valet, finished shaving Thompson's pale face, helped him\r\ndress in striped trousers, cut-away, and white gardenia.\r\n\r\n\"Thank you, Morten,\" said the Secretary of State.\r\n\r\n\"You seem calm enough, sir. Frankly, I'm ill at ease.\"\r\n\r\n\"You may leave the Cellar if you wish,\" Thompson said, skimming through\r\nhis notes. \"You've served graciously. I appreciate it. But it is your\r\nprivilege to return to your family outside now. I might remind you that\r\nyour chance of survival if you remain here is practically 100 percent.\"\r\n\r\n\"It isn't that, sir. It just seems incredible that so many must die.\"\r\nHe felt of his wallet, the pictures of his family in it.\r\n\r\n\"It's hardly a matter of principle,\" Thompson said. \"Nor a question\r\nof ideology. It's simply a question of firmness and realistic\r\npracticality, and getting the job done once and for all. That has been\r\nmy stand from the beginning and naturally it cannot be changed.\"\r\n\r\n\"But billions of people dying--\"\r\n\r\n\"Death before dishonor, Morten.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir.\" Morten knew that in every suite in the Cellar every\r\ndiplomat was saying practically the same thing. Thompson looked up\r\nfrom his neat notes. \"People, Morten, have been properly prepared for\r\nviolent death. Indeed there has been a feeling of security in numbers.\r\nThe Ministry of Education working with the War Department has done such\r\na splendid job. Now every child has grown up fully prepared to die\r\nin the holocaust. And every individual still a child regards violent\r\ndeath as casually as a game of marbles. The required attitude has been\r\nthoroughly conditioned in the populace. The idea was to make violence,\r\nsavagery, and sudden death, an every day affair. And we have done it.\r\nSad, but a necessary task.\"\r\n\r\nMorten said nothing. Thompson looked at the neon map coruscating on the\r\nwall. \"Our country is not unique in this, Morten. Annihilation will\r\ncome as a shock only to the misinformed anywhere in the world.\"\r\n\r\nMorten sat down. He remembered how his kids used to come home from\r\nschool laughingly playing war games, manipulating toy atomic cannons\r\nand the like. They received additional marks in school for being\r\ngood and cooperative during atomic bomb drills and preparations for\r\nthermonuclear disasters. They had been so proud of their dogtags that\r\ncame with boxes of cereal. In the evenings out back they used to have\r\nbury-the-dead games.\r\n\r\nThompson was saying, \"Remember juvenile delinquency? It was necessary.\r\nMillions had to be conditioned psychologically for Operation Killer. An\r\ninsensitive, fatalistic attitude had to be engendered. For their own\r\ngood.\"\r\n\r\nMorten flicked a speck of lint from Thompson's stooped shoulder.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir,\" he said. \"Maybe it will be humane, in the long run.\"\r\n\r\n\"One must face the hard, materialistic facts,\" Thompson said. \"Oh,\r\nthat reminds me.\" He went to his private switchboard and got a secret\r\noutside line to the Office of Civilian Defense. \"Hello, Donnelson.\r\nYes, I'm fine. I haven't talked with you for some time now, and I\r\nwas wondering about that suggestion of mine. Yes, the household pets\r\nthing. That's right, particularly dogs. They're big morale factors in\r\nthe lives of children and there may be some survivors. Well, then,\r\nissue another bulletin on that immediately. Things are reaching a head\r\nhere in the Cellar. Yes, dogs should be lashed firmly to heavy pieces\r\nof furniture, away from windows. Put water where they can reach it.\r\nHysteria under the bombing attacks can be avoided by giving sodium\r\nbromide tablets to the dogs. That's right. Survivors will need pets.\r\nMorale....\"\r\n\r\nAfter Thompson was through talking to Donnelson, Morten said. \"You\r\nknow, sir, the end will be a relief to some people. They've been\r\nblitzed by a non-stop barrage of fear bombs so long, I think they'll be\r\nglad to get it over with.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very perceptive, Morten. That has been one of Psychological Warfare's\r\nprimary aims in preparation.\" Thompson got another outside line.\r\nDawson, Civilian Defense. As he waited for Dawson to come in, he said\r\nto Morten, \"Get the dueling pistols out of the cabinet, please.\" Morten\r\nnodded.\r\n\r\n\"Hello, Dawson. Fine, fine, things coming to a head here. How much\r\ndistribution did you manage on the shrouds? Eighty percent? Excellent.\r\nI haven't heard from Harry on the details for quite a while. Wanted\r\nto check personally. As you say, I've never really lost my touch\r\nwith the grass-roots. My feeling from the start was that millions of\r\nwooden coffins would be out of the question. The olive drab plastic\r\nsheets seemed to be the only practical recourse from the start. The\r\npsychological importance of getting bodies out of sight as rapidly as\r\npossible cannot be overemphasized. Oh, Dawson, one moment ... yes,\r\nI know about the public parks, playgrounds and vacant tracts in the\r\nsuburbs. But what about New York City? The only way is to send the\r\nbodies up the Hudson River using piers as morgues. The problem of\r\nwhere to put so many bodies, particularly when they will all appear\r\nfor disposal at the same time, is a considerable one. Allowing for\r\nthree-by-six grave-sites, with three feet for aisles, the whole\r\nproblem of adequate disposal acreage is primary.\" Thompson switched off\r\nthe connection.\r\n\r\nThompson moved his fingers over the .38 caliber dueling pistols in the\r\nvelvet-lined case. His eyes mellowed with nostalgia. \"Gift from the old\r\nSecretary of War. My boy, Don, learned to shoot with this one when he\r\nwas only six years old. If he had lived to be an adult, he would have\r\nbeen a tough fighter. But he was killed by a rival delinquent gang when\r\nhe was twelve. He only got there a little sooner. He had just finished\r\nreading Niebuhr, so he knew the tragic irony of history.\"\r\n\r\nThompson balanced one of the pistols in his hand. He looked at his\r\nwatch. \"It's time,\" he said religiously.\r\n\r\nAs Thompson entered the Hall of Ministers, the representatives of five\r\nbalance of power nations arose at once in deference to the sixth.\r\nMorten sat unobtrusively in a far corner, holding the case of dueling\r\npistols on his knees.\r\n\r\nThompson sat down. The minutes of the last conference were read by\r\na mechanical secretary. A summation of their final agreement on\r\nOperation Push Button was briefly reviewed by the automatic translating\r\nsecretary. No changes were suggested.\r\n\r\nThe surface of the huge conference table was somewhat like a gigantic\r\ntopographical map of the world. It covered perhaps a thousand square\r\nfeet and had been constructed by brain-washed artisans and engineers\r\nand scientists in perfect electronic detail. It was so realistic\r\nthat it radiated a sort of sentience, seeming almost to breathe in\r\nastonishing precision with the respiration of important strategically\r\nlocated cities, ports, communication and manufacturing centers. Before\r\neach Minister was a console containing several buttons.\r\n\r\nEach Minister arose, made a speech concerning the sovereign rights of\r\nthe particular nation or bloc of nations he represented. In each case,\r\nthe speeches seemed the same to Morten. He knew that if merely the name\r\nof the country or bloc in each speech was changed, the rest would be\r\nthe same, and sound something like:\r\n\r\n\"Gentlemen, a free such-and-such people can no longer tolerate a\r\nmilitant rearming so-and-so. Every other possibility has been discussed\r\nand rejected. I must say now that at this moment a state of war must of\r\nnecessity exist between such-and-such and so-and-so.\"\r\n\r\nMorten had been hearing variations of it for years. He knew it all\r\nby heart. As each Minister made this implacable statement, he sat\r\ndown, and without further ceremony, pushed a button or buttons on his\r\nprivate console. On the topographical map, as a button was pushed, some\r\nimportant section of the map, an area, a city, a port, some significant\r\ntransportation, communication, or manufacturing industrial center,\r\nwould shoot out realistic sparks, smoke, and then crumble into lifeless\r\ndebris.\r\n\r\nMorten tried to control the flinching and twitching of his muscles. An\r\nintricate network of electronic relays connected with thermonuclear\r\nbombs went out all over the world, and were hooked in to the map on\r\nthe conference table. Millions of people were just blown up somewhere,\r\nMorten thought.\r\n\r\nAnother Minister finished his speech, sat down, pressed buttons. More\r\nsmoke and flashes shot up. Millions of others out there somewhere have\r\njust been annihilated, Morten thought. It doesn't seem possible, he\r\nthought then. It's not possible. It's some kind of final madness. But\r\nit's happening.\r\n\r\nIt had been decided that this was the simple direct way, avoiding long,\r\ntime-wasting programs of mobilization and warfare. If the conclusion\r\nwas foregone, had been the question, then why not go directly to it by\r\nthe shortest and most efficient route? And the answer was as inevitable\r\nas the question.\r\n\r\nMore Ministers stood up, made their final declarations, and pushed\r\nbuttons. Little puffballs and clouds of smoke drifted over the\r\nconference table, obscuring distinctive facial outlines and turning the\r\nministers into shadow shapes as Morten watched.\r\n\r\nOnly two of the Ministers had not yet pressed their buttons. Only\r\ntwo sectors of the world remain alive, Morten thought. He coughed\r\nas acrid smoke swirled about the room. He felt a kind of blessed\r\nnumbed paralysis. He could almost feel the whole world turning into a\r\nradioactive hell all around him, mushrooms of gigantic size sprouting\r\nfast and furiously in the last big aftermath of rain. Yet he could\r\nscarcely imagine how it really was now, outside the Cellar. He thought\r\nvaguely about the dogs, wondering how many of them had avoided hysteria\r\nby having been tied to heavy pieces of furniture and given sodium\r\nbromide tablets. The kids who survived would need pets.\r\n\r\nMorten sat there, trying to see through the thickening smoke. He tried\r\nto feel grateful for having been in the Cellar. But in a few more\r\nseconds America might also be destroyed. What then? And what if only\r\nAmerica remained--would that be any better?\r\n\r\nHe had resisted such speculation, but how could he resist it any\r\nlonger? The Ministers had their wives, families, lovers in the Cellar,\r\nand supplies enough to last indefinitely. But Morten's family was\r\noutside. In a few seconds they might be dead. After that nothing.\r\nNothing at all.\r\n\r\nHe heard Thompson say in a calm voice. \"Morten, the pistols.\"\r\n\r\nHe also heard the other Minister say in Russian that he wanted his\r\npistol. Morten had to respect the secret agreement that Thompson and\r\nthe Russian Minister had made yesterday. After the other Ministers\r\npushed their buttons, Thompson and the Russian would fight a duel then\r\nthe survivor of the duel would push his button.\r\n\r\n\"Someone should win,\" Thompson and the Russian had agreed. \"This way,\r\none will be the absolute victor.\"\r\n\r\nIf the other Ministers knew what this secret agreement was they either\r\ndid not care, or did not care enough now. They got up from the\r\nconference table and drifted out of the big spheroid room to their\r\nfamilies, wives--wherever they wanted to go.\r\n\r\nNow only Thompson and the Russian remained in the room. They walked\r\nten paces away from one another in the classic tradition of honorable\r\ndueling, turned, and fired. They fell almost at the same time. Morten\r\nrushed over to Thompson who was already dead, having died instantly\r\nwith a bullet in his heart. Morten saw that the Russian had a bullet\r\nhole just above his left eye.\r\n\r\nThompson, foreseeing this possible situation, had gotten a promise from\r\nMorten that he would press the button that would annihilate Russia, in\r\ncase Thompson was dead or incapacitated. That would leave the United\r\nStates the sole victor in the last great global struggle to establish\r\nonce and for all, world wide, the true faith.\r\n\r\nMorten fought a brief struggle with his conscience, then ran out of\r\nthe room, leaving the console untouched. The United States and Russia\r\nstill survived. Morten's family was still safe. He ran toward the bank\r\nof elevators to get out of the Cellar. He hadn't been out of the Cellar\r\nfor a long, long time.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe President of the United States switched off the TV, and poured\r\nanother martini. \"You want another?\" he asked the Minister of Peace.\r\n\"No, sir, Mr. President.\"\r\n\r\nFor a while they said nothing as they looked out the window at the\r\npeaceful sunshine, and watched birds settle in the trees.\r\n\r\n\"They ran their own course,\" the Minister of Peace said. \"Just the\r\nsame, it was an unpleasant thing to see.\"\r\n\r\n\"Inevitable,\" said the President. \"There wasn't any other possible way\r\nto handle them.\"\r\n\r\nPsychiatry would never have altered their rigid mold, he knew. It was a\r\nstrangely funny thing, that spontaneous rebellion all over the world.\r\nThe people putting a stop to the whole damn vicious historical show.\r\nBut they had done it. The lie had been given to all the historical\r\npessimists like Spencer and Toynbee and Marx and all the others\r\nwho had said the same things, whether they really had admitted it\r\nor not. The people, acting out of intuitive realization that they\r\nfaced annihilation, had reacted _en masse_ and taken things over for\r\nthemselves. Now you couldn't find even a water pistol anywhere in the\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nThe U.N. Cellar had been walled off, turned into a kind of sanitarium.\r\nIts occupants had never known the truth about the outside. Thompson and\r\nthat absurd Russian were dead. But what about the others in the Cellar,\r\nliving there still and believing they were the only few survivors left\r\nin the world?\r\n\r\nPoor bastards, the President thought. And then he thought of that\r\nstatement by Sartre. The one about hell being a restaurant where you\r\nserved yourself."

His\r\nplan of salvation was so narrow, that, like a plank in a tempestuous\r\nsea, it could avail no sinner but himself, who bestrode it\r\ntriumphantly, and hurled anathemas against the wretches whom he saw\r\nstruggling with the billows of eternal death. In his view of the\r\nmatter, it was a most abominable crime—as, indeed, it is a great\r\nfolly—for men to trust to their own strength, or even to grapple to any\r\nother fragment of the wreck, save this narrow plank, which, moreover,\r\nhe took special care to keep out of their reach. In other words, as his\r\ncreed was like no man’s else, and being well pleased that Providence\r\nhad intrusted him alone, of mortals, with the treasure of a true faith,\r\nRichard Digby determined to seclude himself to the sole and constant\r\nenjoyment of his happy fortune.\r\n\r\n“And verily,” thought he, “I deem it a chief condition of Heaven’s\r\nmercy to myself, that I hold no communion with those abominable myriads\r\nwhich it hath cast off to perish. Peradventure, were I to tarry longer\r\nin the tents of Kedar, the gracious boon would be revoked, and I also\r\nbe swallowed up in the deluge of wrath, or consumed in the storm of\r\nfire and brimstone, or involved in whatever new kind of ruin is\r\nordained for the horrible perversity of this generation.”\r\n\r\nSo Richard Digby took an axe, to hew space enough for a tabernacle in\r\nthe wilderness, and some few other necessaries, especially a sword and\r\ngun, to smite and slay any intruder upon his hallowed seclusion; and\r\nplunged into the dreariest depths of the forest. On its verge, however,\r\nhe paused a moment, to shake off the dust of his feet against the\r\nvillage where he had dwelt, and to invoke a curse on the meeting-house,\r\nwhich he regarded as a temple of heathen idolatry. He felt a curiosity,\r\nalso, to see whether the fire and brimstone would not rush down from\r\nHeaven at once, now that the one righteous man had provided for his own\r\nsafety. But, as the sunshine continued to fall peacefully on the\r\ncottages and fields, and the husbandmen labored and children played,\r\nand as there were many tokens of present happiness, and nothing ominous\r\nof a speedy judgment, he turned away, somewhat disappointed. The\r\nfarther he went, however, and the lonelier he felt himself, and the\r\nthicker the trees stood along his path, and the darker the shadow\r\noverhead, so much the more did Richard Digby exult. He talked to\r\nhimself, as he strode onward; he read his Bible to himself, as he sat\r\nbeneath the trees; and, as the gloom of the forest hid the blessed sky,\r\nI had almost added, that, at morning, noon, and eventide, he prayed to\r\nhimself. So congenial was this mode of life to his disposition, that he\r\noften laughed to himself, but was displeased when an echo tossed him\r\nback the long loud roar.\r\n\r\nIn this manner, he journeyed onward three days and two nights, and\r\ncame, on the third evening, to the mouth of a cave, which, at first\r\nsight, reminded him of Elijah’s cave at Horeb, though perhaps it more\r\nresembled Abraham’s sepulchral cave at Machpelah. It entered into the\r\nheart of a rocky hill. There was so dense a veil of tangled foliage\r\nabout it, that none but a sworn lover of gloomy recesses would have\r\ndiscovered the low arch of its entrance, or have dared to step within\r\nits vaulted chamber, where the burning eyes of a panther might\r\nencounter him. If Nature meant this remote and dismal cavern for the\r\nuse of man, it could only be to bury in its gloom the victims of a\r\npestilence, and then to block up its mouth with stones, and avoid the\r\nspot forever after. There was nothing bright nor cheerful near it,\r\nexcept a bubbling fountain, some twenty paces off, at which Richard\r\nDigby hardly threw away a glance. But he thrust his head into the cave,\r\nshivered, and congratulated himself.\r\n\r\n“The finger of Providence hath pointed my way!” cried he, aloud, while\r\nthe tomb-like den returned a strange echo, as if some one within were\r\nmocking him. “Here my soul will be at peace; for the wicked will not\r\nfind me. Here I can read the Scriptures, and be no more provoked with\r\nlying interpretations. Here I can offer up acceptable prayers, because\r\nmy voice will not be mingled with the sinful supplications of the\r\nmultitude. Of a truth, the only way to heaven leadeth through the\r\nnarrow entrance of this cave,—and I alone have found it!”\r\n\r\nIn regard to this cave it was observable that the roof, so far as the\r\nimperfect light permitted it to be seen, was hung with substances\r\nresembling opaque icicles; for the damps of unknown centuries, dripping\r\ndown continually, had become as hard as adamant; and wherever that\r\nmoisture fell, it seemed to possess the power of converting what it\r\nbathed to stone. The fallen leaves and sprigs of foliage, which the\r\nwind had swept into the cave, and the little feathery shrubs, rooted\r\nnear the threshold, were not wet with a natural dew, but had been\r\nembalmed by this wondrous process. And here I am put in mind that\r\nRichard Digby, before he withdrew himself from the world, was supposed\r\nby skilful physicians to have contracted a disease for which no remedy\r\nwas written in their medical books. It was a deposition of calculous\r\nparticles within his heart, caused by an obstructed circulation of the\r\nblood; and, unless a miracle should be wrought for him, there was\r\ndanger that the malady might act on the entire substance of the organ,\r\nand change his fleshy heart to stone. Many, indeed, affirmed that the\r\nprocess was already near its consummation. Richard Digby, however,\r\ncould never be convinced that any such direful work was going on within\r\nhim; nor when he saw the sprigs of marble foliage, did his heart even\r\nthrob the quicker, at the similitude suggested by these once tender\r\nherbs. It may be that this same insensibility was a symptom of the\r\ndisease.\r\n\r\nBe that as it might, Richard Digby was well contented with his\r\nsepulchral cave. So dearly did he love this congenial spot, that,\r\ninstead of going a few paces to the bubbling spring for water, he\r\nallayed his thirst with now and then a drop of moisture from the roof,\r\nwhich, had it fallen anywhere but on his tongue, would have been\r\ncongealed into a pebble. For a man predisposed to stoniness of the\r\nheart, this surely was unwholesome liquor. But there he dwelt, for\r\nthree days more eating herbs and roots, drinking his own destruction,\r\nsleeping, as it were, in a tomb, and awaking to the solitude of death,\r\nyet esteeming this horrible mode of life as hardly inferior to\r\ncelestial bliss. Perhaps superior; for, above the sky, there would be\r\nangels to disturb him. At the close of the third day, he sat in the\r\nportal of his mansion, reading the Bible aloud, because no other ear\r\ncould profit by it, and reading it amiss, because the rays of the\r\nsetting sun did not penetrate the dismal depth of shadow round about\r\nhim, nor fall upon the sacred page. Suddenly, however, a faint gleam of\r\nlight was thrown over the volume, and, raising his eyes, Richard Digby\r\nsaw that a young woman stood before the mouth of the cave, and that the\r\nsunbeams bathed her white garment, which thus seemed to possess a\r\nradiance of its own.\r\n\r\n“Good evening, Richard,” said the girl; “I have come from afar to find\r\nthee.”\r\n\r\nThe slender grace and gentle loveliness of this young woman were at\r\nonce recognized by Richard Digby. Her name was Mary Goffe. She had been\r\na convert to his preaching of the word in England, before he yielded\r\nhimself to that exclusive bigotry which now enfolded him with such an\r\niron grasp that no other sentiment could reach his bosom. When he came\r\na pilgrim to America, she had remained in her father’s hall; but now,\r\nas it appeared, had crossed the ocean after him, impelled by the same\r\nfaith that led other exiles hither, and perhaps by love almost as holy.\r\nWhat else but faith and love united could have sustained so delicate a\r\ncreature, wandering thus far into the forest, with her golden hair\r\ndishevelled by the boughs, and her feet wounded by the thorns? Yet,\r\nweary and faint though she must have been, and affrighted at the\r\ndreariness of the cave, she looked on the lonely man with a mild and\r\npitying expression, such as might beam from an angel’s eyes, towards an\r\nafflicted mortal. But the recluse, frowning sternly upon her, and\r\nkeeping his finger between the leaves of his half-closed Bible,\r\nmotioned her away with his hand.\r\n\r\n“Off!” cried he. “I am sanctified, and thou art sinful. Away!”\r\n\r\n“O Richard,” said she, earnestly, “I have come this weary way because I\r\nheard that a grievous distemper had seized upon thy heart; and a great\r\nPhysician hath given me the skill to cure it. There is no other remedy\r\nthan this which I have brought thee. Turn me not away, therefore, nor\r\nrefuse my medicine; for then must this dismal cave be thy sepulchre.”\r\n\r\n“Away!” replied Richard Digby, still with a dark frown. “My heart is in\r\nbetter condition than thine own. Leave me, earthly one; for the sun is\r\nalmost set; and when no light reaches the door of the cave, then is my\r\nprayer-time.”\r\n\r\nNow, great as was her need, Mary Goffe did not plead with this\r\nstony-hearted man for shelter and protection, nor ask anything whatever\r\nfor her own sake. All her zeal was for his welfare.\r\n\r\n“Come back with me!” she exclaimed, clasping her hands,—“come back to\r\nthy fellow-men; for they need thee, Richard, and thou hast tenfold need\r\nof them. Stay not in this evil den; for the air is chill, and the damps\r\nare fatal; nor will any that perish within it ever find the path to\r\nheaven. Hasten hence, I entreat thee, for thine own soul’s sake; for\r\neither the roof will fall upon thy head, or some other speedy\r\ndestruction is at hand.”\r\n\r\n“Perverse woman!” answered Richard Digby, laughing aloud,—for he was\r\nmoved to bitter mirth by her foolish vehemence,—“I tell thee that the\r\npath to heaven leadeth straight through this narrow portal where I sit.\r\nAnd, moreover, the destruction thou speakest of is ordained, not for\r\nthis blessed cave, but for all other habitations of mankind, throughout\r\nthe earth. Get thee hence speedily, that thou mayst have thy share!”\r\n\r\nSo saving, he opened his Bible again, and fixed his eyes intently on\r\nthe page, being resolved to withdraw his thoughts from this child of\r\nsin and wrath, and to waste no more of his holy breath upon her. The\r\nshadow had now grown so deep, where he was sitting, that he made\r\ncontinual mistakes in what he read, converting all that was gracious\r\nand merciful to denunciations of vengeance and unutterable woe on every\r\ncreated being but himself. Mary Goffe, meanwhile, was leaning against a\r\ntree, beside the sepulchral cave, very sad, yet with something heavenly\r\nand ethereal in her unselfish sorrow. The light from the setting sun\r\nstill glorified her form, and was reflected a little way within the\r\ndarksome den, discovering so terrible a gloom that the maiden shuddered\r\nfor its self-doomed inhabitant. Espying the bright fountain near at\r\nhand, she hastened thither, and scooped up a portion of its water, in a\r\ncup of birchen bark. A few tears mingled with the draught, and perhaps\r\ngave it all its efficacy. She then returned to the mouth of the cave,\r\nand knelt down at Richard Digby’s feet.\r\n\r\n“Richard,” she said, with passionate fervor, yet a gentleness in all\r\nher passion, “I pray thee, by thy hope of heaven, and as thou wouldst\r\nnot dwell in this tomb forever, drink of this hallowed water, be it but\r\na single drop! Then, make room for me by thy side, and let us read\r\ntogether one page of that blessed volume; and, lastly, kneel down with\r\nme and pray! Do this, and thy stony heart shall become softer than a\r\nbabe’s, and all be well.”\r\n\r\nBut Richard Digby, in utter abhorrence of the proposal, cast the Bible\r\nat his feet, and eyed her with such a fixed and evil frown, that he\r\nlooked less like a living man than a marble statue, wrought by some\r\ndark-imagined sculptor to express the most repulsive mood that human\r\nfeatures could assume. And, as his look grew even devilish, so, with an\r\nequal change did Mary Goffe become more sad, more mild, more pitiful,\r\nmore like a sorrowing angel. But, the more heavenly she was, the more\r\nhateful did she seem to Richard Digby, who at length raised his hand,\r\nand smote down the cup of hallowed water upon the threshold of the\r\ncave, thus rejecting the only medicine that could have cured his stony\r\nheart. A sweet perfume lingered in the air for a moment, and then was\r\ngone.\r\n\r\n“Tempt me no more, accursed woman,” exclaimed he, still with his marble\r\nfrown, “lest I smite thee down also! What hast thou to do with my\r\nBible?—what with my prayers?—what with my heaven?”\r\n\r\nNo sooner had he spoken these dreadful words, than Richard Digby’s\r\nheart ceased to beat; while—so the legend says-the form of Mary Goffe\r\nmelted into the last sunbeams, and returned from the sepulchral cave to\r\nheaven. For Mary Golfe had been buried in an English churchyard, months\r\nbefore; and either it was her ghost that haunted the wild forest, or\r\nelse a dream-like spirit, typifying pure Religion.\r\n\r\nAbove a century afterwards, when the trackless forest of Richard\r\nDigby’s day had long been interspersed with settlements, the children\r\nof a neighboring farmer were playing at the foot of a hill. The trees,\r\non account of the rude and broken surface of this acclivity, had never\r\nbeen felled, and were crowded so densely together as to hide all but a\r\nfew rocky prominences, wherever their roots could grapple with the\r\nsoil. A little boy and girl, to conceal themselves from their\r\nplaymates, had crept into the deepest shade, where not only the\r\ndarksome pines, but a thick veil of creeping plants suspended from an\r\noverhanging rock, combined to make a twilight at noonday, and almost a\r\nmidnight at all other seasons. There the children hid themselves, and\r\nshouted, repeating the cry at intervals, till the whole party of\r\npursuers were drawn thither, and, pulling aside the matted foliage, let\r\nin a doubtful glimpse of daylight. But scarcely was this accomplished,\r\nwhen the little group uttered a simultaneous shriek, and tumbled\r\nheadlong down the hill, making the best of their way homeward, without\r\na second glance into the gloomy recess. Their father, unable to\r\ncomprehend what had so startled them, took his axe, and, by felling one\r\nor two trees, and tearing away the creeping plants, laid the mystery\r\nopen to the day. He had discovered the entrance of a cave, closely\r\nresembling the mouth of a sepulchre, within which sat the figure of a\r\nman, whose gesture and attitude warned the father and children to stand\r\nback, while his visage wore a most forbidding frown. This repulsive\r\npersonage seemed to have been carved in the same gray stone that formed\r\nthe walls and portal of the cave. On minuter inspection, indeed, such\r\nblemishes were observed, as made it doubtful whether the figure were\r\nreally a statue, chiselled by human art and somewhat worn and defaced\r\nby the lapse of ages, or a freak of Nature, who might have chosen to\r\nimitate, in stone, her usual handiwork of flesh. Perhaps it was the\r\nleast unreasonable idea, suggested by this strange spectacle, that the\r\nmoisture of the cave possessed a petrifying quality, which had thus\r\nawfully embalmed a human corpse.\r\n\r\nThere was something so frightful in the aspect of this Man of Adamant,\r\nthat the farmer, the moment that he recovered from the fascination of\r\nhis first gaze, began to heap stones into the mouth of the cavern. His\r\nwife, who had followed him to the hill, assisted her husband’s efforts.\r\nThe children, also, approached as near as they durst, with their little\r\nhands full of pebbles, and cast them on the pile. Earth was then thrown\r\ninto the crevices, and the whole fabric overlaid with sods. Thus all\r\ntraces of the discovery were obliterated, leaving only a marvellous\r\nlegend, which grew wilder from one generation to another, as the\r\nchildren told it to their grandchildren, and they to their posterity,\r\ntill few believed that there had ever been a cavern or a statue, where\r\nnow they saw but a grassy patch on the shadowy hillside. Yet, grown\r\npeople avoid the spot, nor do children play there. Friendship, and\r\nLove, and Piety, all human and celestial sympathies, should keep aloof\r\nfrom that hidden cave; for there still sits, and, unless an earthquake\r\ncrumble down the roof upon his head, shall sit forever, the shape of\r\nRichard Digby, in the attitude of repelling the whole race of\r\nmortals,—not from heaven,—but from the horrible loneliness of his dark,\r\ncold sepulchre!"

Jerome\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Kindness,\" argued little Mrs. Pennycoop, \"costs nothing.\"\r\n\r\n\"And, speaking generally, my dear, is valued precisely at cost\r\nprice,\" retorted Mr. Pennycoop, who, as an auctioneer of twenty years'\r\nexperience, had enjoyed much opportunity of testing the attitude of the\r\npublic towards sentiment.\r\n\r\n\"I don't care what you say, George,\" persisted his wife; \"he may be\r\na disagreeable, cantankerous old brute--I don't say he isn't. All the\r\nsame, the man is going away, and we may never see him again.\"\r\n\r\n\"If I thought there was any fear of our doing so,\" observed Mr.\r\nPennycoop, \"I'd turn my back on the Church of England to-morrow and\r\nbecome a Methodist.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't talk like that, George,\" his wife admonished him, reprovingly;\r\n\"the Lord might be listening to you.\"\r\n\r\n\"If the Lord had to listen to old Cracklethorpe He'd sympathize with\r\nme,\" was the opinion of Mr. Pennycoop.\r\n\r\n\"The Lord sends us our trials, and they are meant for our good,\"\r\nexplained his wife. \"They are meant to teach us patience.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are not churchwarden,\" retorted her husband; \"you can get away from\r\nhim. You hear him when he is in the pulpit, where, to a certain extent,\r\nhe is bound to keep his temper.\"\r\n\r\n\"You forget the rummage sale, George,\" Mrs. Pennycoop reminded him; \"to\r\nsay nothing of the church decorations.\"\r\n\r\n\"The rummage sale,\" Mr. Pennycoop pointed out to her, \"occurs only once\r\na year, and at that time your own temper, I have noticed--\"\r\n\r\n\"I always try to remember I am a Christian,\" interrupted little Mrs.\r\nPennycoop. \"I do not pretend to be a saint, but whatever I say I am\r\nalways sorry for it afterwards--you know I am, George.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's what I am saying,\" explained her husband. \"A vicar who has\r\ncontrived in three years to make every member of his congregation hate\r\nthe very sight of a church--well, there's something wrong about it\r\nsomewhere.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Pennycoop, gentlest of little women, laid her plump and still\r\npretty hands upon her husband's shoulders. \"Don't think, dear, I\r\nhaven't sympathized with you. You have borne it nobly. I have marvelled\r\nsometimes that you have been able to control yourself as you have done,\r\nmost times; the things that he has said to you.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Pennycoop had slid unconsciously into an attitude suggestive of\r\npetrified virtue, lately discovered.\r\n\r\n\"One's own poor self,\" observed Mr. Pennycoop, in accents of proud\r\nhumility--\"insults that are merely personal one can put up with. Though\r\neven there,\" added the senior churchwarden, with momentary descent\r\ntowards the plane of human nature, \"nobody cares to have it hinted\r\npublicly across the vestry table that one has chosen to collect from\r\nthe left side for the express purpose of artfully passing over one's own\r\nfamily.\"\r\n\r\n\"The children have always had their three-penny-bits ready waiting in\r\ntheir hands,\" explained Mrs. Pennycoop, indignantly.\r\n\r\n\"It's the sort of thing he says merely for the sake of making a\r\ndisturbance,\" continued the senior churchwarden. \"It's the things he\r\ndoes I draw the line at.\"\r\n\r\n\"The things he has done, you mean, dear,\" laughed the little woman, with\r\nthe accent on the \"has.\" \"It is all over now, and we are going to be\r\nrid of him. I expect, dear, if we only knew, we should find it was his\r\nliver. You know, George, I remarked to you the first day that he came\r\nhow pasty he looked and what a singularly unpleasant mouth he had.\r\nPeople can't help these things, you know, dear. One should look upon\r\nthem in the light of afflictions and be sorry for them.\"\r\n\r\n\"I could forgive him doing what he does if he didn't seem to enjoy it,\"\r\nsaid the senior churchwarden. \"But, as you say, dear, he is going, and\r\nall I hope and pray is that we never see his like again.\"\r\n\r\n\"And you'll come with me to call upon him, George,\" urged kind little\r\nMrs. Pennycoop. \"After all, he has been our vicar for three years, and\r\nhe must be feeling it, poor man--whatever he may pretend--going away\r\nlike this, knowing that everybody is glad to see the back of him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I sha'n't say anything I don't really feel,\" stipulated Mr.\r\nPennycoop.\r\n\r\n\"That will be all right, dear,\" laughed his wife, \"so long as you don't\r\nsay what you do feel. And we'll both of us keep our temper,\" further\r\nsuggested the little woman, \"whatever happens. Remember, it will be for\r\nthe last time.\"\r\n\r\nLittle Mrs. Pennycoop's intention was kind and Christianlike. The Rev.\r\nAugustus Cracklethorpe would be quitting Wychwood-on-the-Heath the\r\nfollowing Monday, never to set foot--so the Rev. Augustus Cracklethorpe\r\nhimself and every single member of his congregation hoped sincerely--in\r\nthe neighbourhood again. Hitherto no pains had been taken on either side\r\nto disguise the mutual joy with which the parting was looked forward\r\nto. The Rev. Augustus Cracklethorpe, M.A., might possibly have been\r\nof service to his Church in, say, some East-end parish of unsavoury\r\nreputation, some mission station far advanced amid the hordes of\r\nheathendom. There his inborn instinct of antagonism to everybody and\r\neverything surrounding him, his unconquerable disregard for other\r\npeople's views and feelings, his inspired conviction that everybody but\r\nhimself was bound to be always wrong about everything, combined with\r\ndetermination to act and speak fearlessly in such belief, might have\r\nfound their uses. In picturesque little Wychwood-on-the-Heath, among the\r\nKentish hills, retreat beloved of the retired tradesman, the spinster\r\nof moderate means, the reformed Bohemian developing latent instincts\r\ntowards respectability, these qualities made only for scandal and\r\ndisunion.\r\n\r\nFor the past two years the Rev. Cracklethorpe's parishioners, assisted\r\nby such other of the inhabitants of Wychwood-on-the-Heath as had\r\nhappened to come into personal contact with the reverend gentleman,\r\nhad sought to impress upon him, by hints and innuendoes difficult to\r\nmisunderstand, their cordial and daily-increasing dislike of him, both\r\nas a parson and a man. Matters had come to a head by the determination\r\nofficially announced to him that, failing other alternatives, a\r\ndeputation of his leading parishioners would wait upon his bishop. This\r\nit was that had brought it home to the Rev. Augustus Cracklethorpe that,\r\nas the spiritual guide and comforter of Wychwood-on-the Heath, he had\r\nproved a failure. The Rev. Augustus had sought and secured the care of\r\nother souls. The following Sunday morning he had arranged to preach his\r\nfarewell sermon, and the occasion promised to be a success from every\r\npoint of view. Churchgoers who had not visited St. Jude's for months\r\nhad promised themselves the luxury of feeling they were listening to\r\nthe Rev. Augustus Cracklethorpe for the last time. The Rev. Augustus\r\nCracklethorpe had prepared a sermon that for plain speaking and\r\ndirectness was likely to leave an impression. The parishioners of St.\r\nJude's, Wychwood-on-the-Heath, had their failings, as we all have. The\r\nRev. Augustus flattered himself that he had not missed out a single one,\r\nand was looking forward with pleasurable anticipation to the sensation\r\nthat his remarks, from his \"firstly\" to his \"sixthly and lastly,\" were\r\nlikely to create.\r\n\r\nWhat marred the entire business was the impulsiveness of little Mrs.\r\nPennycoop. The Rev. Augustus Cracklethorpe, informed in his study on the\r\nWednesday afternoon that Mr. and Mrs. Pennycoop had called, entered the\r\ndrawing-room a quarter of an hour later, cold and severe; and, without\r\noffering to shake hands, requested to be informed as shortly as possible\r\nfor what purpose he had been disturbed. Mrs. Pennycoop had had her\r\nspeech ready to her tongue. It was just what it should have been, and no\r\nmore.\r\n\r\nIt referred casually, without insisting on the point, to the duty\r\nincumbent upon all of us to remember on occasion we were Christians;\r\nthat our privilege it was to forgive and forget; that, generally\r\nspeaking, there are faults on both sides; that partings should never\r\ntake place in anger; in short, that little Mrs. Pennycoop and George,\r\nher husband, as he was waiting to say for himself, were sorry for\r\neverything and anything they may have said or done in the past to hurt\r\nthe feelings of the Rev. Augustus Cracklethorpe, and would like to shake\r\nhands with him and wish him every happiness for the future. The chilling\r\nattitude of the Rev. Augustus scattered that carefully-rehearsed speech\r\nto the winds. It left Mrs. Pennycoop nothing but to retire in choking\r\nsilence, or to fling herself upon the inspiration of the moment and make\r\nup something new. She choose the latter alternative.\r\n\r\nAt first the words came halting. Her husband, man-like, had deserted\r\nher in her hour of utmost need and was fumbling with the door-knob. The\r\nsteely stare with which the Rev. Cracklethorpe regarded her, instead\r\nof chilling her, acted upon her as a spur. It put her on her mettle. He\r\nshould listen to her. She would make him understand her kindly feeling\r\ntowards him if she had to take him by the shoulders and shake it into\r\nhim. At the end of five minutes the Rev. Augustus Cracklethorpe,\r\nwithout knowing it, was looking pleased. At the end of another five Mrs.\r\nPennycoop stopped, not for want of words, but for want of breath.\r\nThe Rev. Augustus Cracklethorpe replied in a voice that, to his own\r\nsurprise, was trembling with emotion. Mrs. Pennycoop had made his task\r\nharder for him. He had thought to leave Wychwood-on-the-Heath without a\r\nregret. The knowledge he now possessed, that at all events one member of\r\nhis congregation understood him, as Mrs. Pennycoop had proved to him she\r\nunderstood him, sympathized with him--the knowledge that at least\r\none heart, and that heart Mrs. Pennycoop's, had warmed to him, would\r\ntransform what he had looked forward to as a blessed relief into a\r\nlasting grief.\r\n\r\nMr. Pennycoop, carried away by his wife's eloquence, added a few halting\r\nwords of his own. It appeared from Mr. Pennycoop's remarks that he had\r\nalways regarded the Rev. Augustus Cracklethorpe as the vicar of his\r\ndreams, but misunderstandings in some unaccountable way will arise. The\r\nRev. Augustus Cracklethorpe, it appeared, had always secretly respected\r\nMr. Pennycoop. If at any time his spoken words might have conveyed\r\nthe contrary impression, that must have arisen from the poverty of our\r\nlanguage, which does not lend itself to subtle meanings.\r\n\r\nThen following the suggestion of tea, Miss Cracklethorpe, sister to the\r\nRev. Augustus--a lady whose likeness to her brother in all respects\r\nwas startling, the only difference between them being that while he was\r\nclean-shaven she wore a slight moustache--was called down to grace the\r\nboard. The visit was ended by Mrs. Pennycoop's remembrance that it was\r\nWilhelmina's night for a hot bath.\r\n\r\n\"I said more than I intended to,\" admitted Mrs. Pennycoop to George, her\r\nhusband, on the way home; \"but he irritated me.\"\r\n\r\nRumour of the Pennycoops' visit flew through the parish. Other ladies\r\nfelt it their duty to show to Mrs. Pennycoop that she was not the only\r\nChristian in Wychwood-on-the-Heath. Mrs. Pennycoop, it was feared, might\r\nbe getting a swelled head over this matter. The Rev. Augustus, with\r\npardonable pride, repeated some of the things that Mrs. Pennycoop had\r\nsaid to him. Mrs. Pennycoop was not to imagine herself the only person\r\nin Wychwood-on-the-Heath capable of generosity that cost nothing. Other\r\nladies could say graceful nothings--could say them even better. Husbands\r\ndressed in their best clothes and carefully rehearsed were brought in\r\nto grace the almost endless procession of disconsolate parishioners\r\nhammering at the door of St. Jude's parsonage. Between Thursday morning\r\nand Saturday night the Rev. Augustus, much to his own astonishment, had\r\nbeen forced to the conclusion that five-sixths of his parishioners had\r\nloved him from the first without hitherto having had opportunity of\r\nexpressing their real feelings.\r\n\r\nThe eventful Sunday arrived. The Rev. Augustus Cracklethorpe had been\r\nkept so busy listening to regrets at his departure, assurances of\r\nan esteem hitherto disguised from him, explanations of seeming\r\ndiscourtesies that had been intended as tokens of affectionate regard,\r\nthat no time had been left to him to think of other matters. Not till\r\nhe entered the vestry at five minutes to eleven did recollection of his\r\nfarewell sermon come to him. It haunted him throughout the service.\r\nTo deliver it after the revelations of the last three days would be\r\nimpossible. It was the sermon that Moses might have preached to Pharaoh\r\nthe Sunday prior to the exodus. To crush with it this congregation of\r\nbroken-hearted adorers sorrowing for his departure would be inhuman.\r\nThe Rev. Augustus tried to think of passages that might be selected,\r\naltered. There were none. From beginning to end it contained not a\r\nsingle sentence capable of being made to sound pleasant by any ingenuity\r\nwhatsoever.\r\n\r\nThe Rev. Augustus Cracklethorpe climbed slowly up the pulpit steps\r\nwithout an idea in his head of what he was going to say. The sunlight\r\nfell upon the upturned faces of a crowd that filled every corner of\r\nthe church. So happy, so buoyant a congregation the eyes of the Rev.\r\nAugustus Cracklethorpe had never till that day looked down upon. The\r\nfeeling came to him that he did not want to leave them. That they\r\ndid not wish him to go, could he doubt? Only by regarding them as a\r\ncollection of the most shameless hypocrites ever gathered together\r\nunder one roof. The Rev. Augustus Cracklethorpe dismissed the passing\r\nsuspicion as a suggestion of the Evil One, folded the neatly-written\r\nmanuscript that lay before him on the desk, and put it aside. He had\r\nno need of a farewell sermon. The arrangements made could easily be\r\naltered. The Rev. Augustus Cracklethorpe spoke from his pulpit for the\r\nfirst time an impromptu.\r\n\r\nThe Rev. Augustus Cracklethorpe wished to acknowledge himself in the\r\nwrong. Foolishly founding his judgment upon the evidence of a few\r\nmen, whose names there would be no need to mention, members of\r\nthe congregation who, he hoped, would one day be sorry for the\r\nmisunderstandings they had caused, brethren whom it was his duty\r\nto forgive, he had assumed the parishioners of St. Jude's,\r\nWychwood-on-the-Heath, to have taken a personal dislike to him. He\r\nwished to publicly apologize for the injustice he had unwittingly done\r\nto their heads and to their hearts. He now had it from their own lips\r\nthat a libel had been put upon them. So far from their wishing his\r\ndeparture, it was self-evident that his going would inflict upon them\r\na great sorrow. With the knowledge he now possessed of the respect--one\r\nmight almost say the veneration--with which the majority of that\r\ncongregation regarded him--knowledge, he admitted, acquired somewhat\r\nlate--it was clear to him he could still be of help to them in their\r\nspiritual need. To leave a flock so devoted would stamp him as an\r\nunworthy shepherd. The ceaseless stream of regrets at his departure that\r\nhad been poured into his ear during the last four days he had decided\r\nat the last moment to pay heed to. He would remain with them--on one\r\ncondition.\r\n\r\nThere quivered across the sea of humanity below him a movement that\r\nmight have suggested to a more observant watcher the convulsive\r\nclutchings of some drowning man at some chance straw. But the Rev.\r\nAugustus Cracklethorpe was thinking of himself.\r\n\r\nThe parish was large and he was no longer a young man. Let them provide\r\nhim with a conscientious and energetic curate. He had such a one in his\r\nmind's eye, a near relation of his own, who, for a small stipend that\r\nwas hardly worth mentioning, would, he knew it for a fact, accept the\r\npost. The pulpit was not the place in which to discuss these matters,\r\nbut in the vestry afterwards he would be pleased to meet such members of\r\nthe congregation as might choose to stay.\r\n\r\nThe question agitating the majority of the congregation during the\r\nsinging of the hymn was the time it would take them to get outside\r\nthe church. There still remained a faint hope that the Rev. Augustus\r\nCracklethorpe, not obtaining his curate, might consider it due to his\r\nown dignity to shake from his feet the dust of a parish generous in\r\nsentiment, but obstinately close-fisted when it came to putting its\r\nhands into its pockets.\r\n\r\nBut for the parishioners of St. Jude's that Sunday was a day of\r\nmisfortune. Before there could be any thought of moving, the Rev.\r\nAugustus raised his surpliced arm and begged leave to acquaint them with\r\nthe contents of a short note that had just been handed up to him. It\r\nwould send them all home, he felt sure, with joy and thankfulness in\r\ntheir hearts. An example of Christian benevolence was among them that\r\ndid honour to the Church.\r\n\r\nHere a retired wholesale clothier from the East-end of London--a short,\r\ntubby gentleman who had recently taken the Manor House--was observed to\r\nturn scarlet.\r\n\r\nA gentleman hitherto unknown to them had signalled his advent among them\r\nby an act of munificence that should prove a shining example to all rich\r\nmen. Mr. Horatio Copper--the reverend gentleman found some difficulty,\r\napparently, in deciphering the name.\r\n\r\n\"Cooper-Smith, sir, with an hyphen,\" came in a thin whisper, the voice\r\nof the still scarlet-faced clothier.\r\n\r\nMr. Horatio Cooper-Smith, taking--the Rev. Augustus felt confident--a\r\nnot unworthy means of grappling to himself thus early the hearts of his\r\nfellow-townsmen, had expressed his desire to pay for the expense of a\r\ncurate entirely out of his own pocket. Under these circumstances,\r\nthere would be no further talk of a farewell between the Rev. Augustus\r\nCracklethorpe and his parishioners. It would be the hope of the Rev.\r\nAugustus Cracklethorpe to live and die the pastor of St. Jude's.\r\n\r\nA more solemn-looking, sober congregation than the congregation that\r\nemerged that Sunday morning from St. Jude's in Wychwood-on-the-Heath had\r\nnever, perhaps, passed out of a church door.\r\n\r\n\"He'll have more time upon his hands,\" said Mr. Biles, retired wholesale\r\nironmonger and junior churchwarden, to Mrs. Biles, turning the corner\r\nof Acacia Avenue--\"he'll have more time to make himself a curse and a\r\nstumbling-block.\"\r\n\r\n\"And if this 'near relation' of his is anything like him--\"\r\n\r\n\"Which you may depend upon it is the Case, or he'd never have thought of\r\nhim,\" was the opinion of Mr. Biles.\r\n\r\n\"I shall give that Mrs. Pennycoop,\" said Mrs. Biles, \"a piece of my mind\r\nwhen I meet her.\"\r\n\r\nBut of what use was that?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's The Cost of Kindness, by Jerome K.

And Nestor\r\n            had only one thought in his brain: save money!\r\n\r\n           [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\r\n              Imagination Stories of Science and Fantasy\r\n                             October 1958\r\n         Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\r\n         the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe old robot was one of the few remaining hand-made productions of\r\nthe Rotulian era--an era which had seen each individually constructed\r\nrobot reach the zenith in the various professional fields. An era\r\ntotally unlike present-day Cornusia and its slip-shod electro-assembly\r\nline robotic productions. And indeed slip-shod were these productions,\r\nmany Cornusians agreed. Loudly and indignantly they howled that the\r\nstupid Cornusian robots, conspicuous by their dress (multicolored sport\r\ncoats, striped trousers, curling shoes and brightly feathered hats) did\r\nnothing but prance around all day and engage in horseplay.\r\n\r\nNot so the old robot....\r\n\r\nFrom that long-ago day when his final bolts had been lovingly tightened\r\nby grimy machinists and tabac-chewing electronicians, he had been\r\nfabulous. Even the Rotulian elders, accustomed as they were to robotic\r\nachievements, had been stunned by his rapid rise in the fields of\r\nfinance and economics. And even the irascible bearded banker, Tesmit\r\nLowndes, after an eighty year association with the robot in investment\r\ncircles, would admit, although grudgingly if questioned, that the robot\r\nwas \"sharp with a kredit.\"\r\n\r\nUpon the early demise of the elder Lowndes (at age ninety, and there\r\nwere raised eyebrows in Cornusian society at such an early departure)\r\nhis will, officially striped in red and green and properly opened\r\nin the presence of the required seven witnesses was found to state\r\nunequivocally: \"It is my last testament, under the laws of Cornusia,\r\nthat my longtime and good friend Nestor shall operate the finances\r\nof my estate for my son Harry, sole survivor, until....\" And there\r\nfollowed, set down in tiny multitudinous lines of legal terminology\r\npeculiar to the age, the conditions and the length of the operation of\r\nthe estate.\r\n\r\nSo it was that the robot Nestor became involved, through no fault of\r\nhis own, with certain people who--\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"Nestor,\" said Harry Lowndes to the robot who had entered the study\r\nin answer to the pull on the bell cord, \"I must have an advance on my\r\nallowance.\"\r\n\r\nNestor stopped just inside the door. He was a small and chunky robot,\r\nmuch older than the slender six-tube types presently in use. His somber\r\nclothing, unlike the gaily clad, stupid Cornusian robots, gave evidence\r\nthat he was a production of the Rotulian era. A blue-serge suit decked\r\nhis blocky metal frame. A conservative black and white zebraic tie,\r\na type popular with professional men, was knotted neatly into his\r\nspotlessly white button-down collar and draped in graceful folds over\r\nhis aud screen. Thick, horn-rimmed focals perched on his stub nose and\r\nmagnified his magenta eye sockets.\r\n\r\nHe was carrying two bulky ledgers, a huge well-worn legal-looking\r\nvolume and half a dozen much-thumbed copies of the Uni-Worlds Financial\r\nJournal. As Lowndes finished speaking Nestor shuffled toward the desk,\r\nset the armload down and stepped back, removing his black bowler and\r\nexposing to Lowndes' view a worn, blue-gray pate from which tiny specks\r\nof aconium flaked--a sign of rapid aging in the Rotulian robot.\r\n\r\n\"Master Lowndes,\" said Nestor, \"an advance will be impossible.\r\nAccording to the terms of your late father's will--\"\r\n\r\nLowndes interrupted, red-faced. He slammed his fist down on the\r\ndesk top. \"All right. All right, Nestor,\" he growled. \"So my father\r\nleft you, his financial adviser, in charge of the estate. I'm not\r\ncomplaining. You're making kredits. But can't you loosen up a little\r\nbit? All I need is a five hundred advance on next month's allowance.\"\r\n\r\nNestor leaned forward to place the black bowler on the corner of the\r\ndesk. \"I'm sorry, Master,\" he said, straightening back up slowly. \"The\r\nwill allows you one thousand kredits.\"\r\n\r\n\"I know what the will allows me,\" yelled Lowndes.\r\n\r\n\"Master,\" said Nestor, \"I am trying to preserve the estate. Your\r\ninterests are paramount with--\"\r\n\r\n\"Nestor, I've got to have five hundred kredits!\"\r\n\r\nThe robot did not answer. His aud lights flickered.\r\n\r\nLowndes cooled down. \"Nestor,\" he asked, \"can't you find a loophole in\r\nthe terms of the will?\" He pointed to the legal-looking volume setting\r\non the desk. \"How about digging through that?\"\r\n\r\nNestor did not answer. His aud lights still flickered fitfully.\r\n\r\n\"Nestor, I am sorry I spoke shortly to you.\"\r\n\r\nSilence.\r\n\r\nLowndes stared at the motionless robot. \"Now look here Nestor, you\r\nheard me apologize.\"\r\n\r\nStill silence.\r\n\r\n\"Please, Nestor,\" Lowndes pleaded. \"I know you can figure out a way.\r\nJust this once. Please Nestor.\"\r\n\r\nSuddenly Nestor's cranial lights lit up. His aud lights flashed on. He\r\nlooked like a Christmas tree. His relays began to click-clack. His aud\r\nbox hummed. He sounded like a swarm of bees.\r\n\r\nLowndes stared in amazement. Nestor's deep thought processes never\r\nfailed to fascinate him. As he watched, abruptly all the lights cut\r\nout. The relays gave a final \"clack.\" For a minute there was silence.\r\nThen Nestor spoke: \"Master, I have converted a majority of the\r\nholdings ... yet five hundred cash kredits remain in Central National\r\nRepository. Under provisions of section four, paragraph seven,\r\nsub-paragraph eighteen of the Quarto Code, this amount could be carried\r\nto the ledgers as a gift to you, deductible. Your signature would not\r\nbe required for the cash transfer.\"\r\n\r\nLowndes eyes gleamed. \"I'm proud of you, Nestor. How long will it take\r\nto get the kredits?\"\r\n\r\n\"Master, as I mentioned, I have converted all but--\"\r\n\r\n\"For pete's sake Nestor, I've got to have those kredits by seven\r\ntonight!\"\r\n\r\n\"Master, please! Allow me to explain the disposition of the converted\r\nassets. I am certain that we are facing a recession comparable to that\r\nsuffered by the ancients in the twenty-ninth year of the twentieth\r\ncentury. Therefore, I have withdrawn--\"\r\n\r\nAgain Lowndes broke in. \"Look, Nestor, tell me later. Let's get the\r\nfive hundred!\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps we should reconsider, Master. Even though legal, this action\r\nis irregular.\"\r\n\r\n\"Reconsider! Whadya mean, reconsider! You figured it out, didn't you?\r\nNestor, someday you'll blow your tubes from worry. Now how about\r\ngetting those kredits!\"\r\n\r\n\"All right, Master. I shall go.\" The robot shuffled from the study, his\r\ntempite joints creaking with age.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nLowndes stared after him. So Nestor was converting assets, he thought.\r\nHe'd bet a herd of two-headed Venusian horses that the robot would\r\nmore than quadruple any investment. He'd probably buy into some\r\nnew uni-space enterprise. Even though it rankled to have the robot\r\ncontrolling the finances, still he had to admit that old Nestor was a\r\nfinancial wizard. Under the terms of the will of the departed elder\r\nLowndes, Nestor was to control the estate investments until Harry\r\nreached the age of thirty--or until Nestor ceased operating. And in\r\nthe meantime, though it was at times galling to have to live on the\r\nallowance--Harry termed it a dole--of one thousand kredits a month, he\r\nconsoled himself by reflecting that Nestor couldn't possibly last much\r\nlonger--he'd already had several major overhauls. Besides, he, Harry,\r\nwould be thirty in three more years. Anyway, Nestor wasn't too hard\r\nto get along with. He was just too conscientious. But he _was_ making\r\nkredits by the barrelful. Harry thought, I've been pretty lucky talking\r\nNestor out of the five hundred. Maybe I've found the secret of handling\r\nhim. Anyway, I'd better watch myself. If I couldn't pay Sliman, I'd\r\nreally be in the soup. At the thought of Sliman, he scowled. Too bad I\r\ncan't take Nestor down there and clean out that sharp-suited gambler.\r\nToo bad the law forbids calculators like Nestor to enter establishments\r\nsuch as Sliman's Snake Eyes Club. Wow! What Nestor wouldn't do to\r\nSliman's roulette wheel. And as for the dice game--! Well, he'd pay\r\nSliman the five hundred and that'd be all! He was through!! From now on\r\nhe'd better devote his time to Judy. Of course, he reflected, she was a\r\ntrifle expensive for his one thousand kredit allowance, always wanting\r\njewelry and those cute Martian minks, but--His thoughts shifted. She'll\r\nbe plenty burned, he thought, because I didn't show up at the Krinkled\r\nWorlds Club last night. I should never have stopped in at Sliman's when\r\nI had a date with her. Apologies are definitely in order. I'd better\r\ntalk to her and get out of the dog--\r\n\r\nThe video-screen hanging on the wall shrilled. He got up from the desk,\r\nwalked over to press the \"On\" switch.\r\n\r\nThe head and shoulders of an attractive female appeared on the screen.\r\nHer shoulder length auburn hair framed a face dominated by green eyes\r\nand sulky red lips.\r\n\r\n\"Judy,\" said Lowndes enthusiastically, \"I was just thinking of you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't 'Judy' me, you beast,\" she flung back at him.\r\n\r\n\"Why, sweets, what's wrong?\" he asked innocently.\r\n\r\n\"You know well enough what's wrong,\" she flared. \"I waited for you\r\nat the Club last night. But you never showed!\" Her temper, clued by\r\nher auburn hair, was showing. \"And I waited for my birthday present!\r\nBut I suppose it never occurred to you\"--she stressed the _you_\r\nnastily--\"that last evening was _also_ my birthday!\"\r\n\r\n\"Sweets, I'm sorry.\" He sidled away from the green eyes glaring at him\r\nand added, \"I'll see you tonight at eight-thirty.\"\r\n\r\nShe snorted. Then, noticing his furtive movement away from her she\r\nyelled, \"Harry Lowndes, you come right back here in front of this\r\nscreen where I can see you. I want to know where you were last night!\"\r\n\r\nHe came back, a sheepish grin spread over his face. \"I stopped in at\r\nSliman's,\" he said.\r\n\r\nHer carmined lips tightened. \"Sliman's! All right, Harry Lowndes, how\r\nmuch did you lose?\"\r\n\r\n\"Five hundred.\"\r\n\r\nHer green eyes flashed. \"Lost five hundred!\" she screamed. \"That five\r\nhundred would have bought me a birthday present!\" Her voice dropped\r\nseveral octaves. \"I'm through, Harry. I'm sending your ring back in the\r\nmorning.\"\r\n\r\nHe was shaken. \"Sweets, it'll never happen again. I'm paying Sliman\r\noff tonight and, believe me, sweets it is the last time.\"\r\n\r\n\"I mean it, Harry.\"\r\n\r\nHe groaned. \"Judy, please! What of our plans?\"\r\n\r\n\"Plans! Did you think I'd marry you on a pitiful one thousand kredits a\r\nmonth?\"\r\n\r\nHe was desperate. \"Judy, you can't do this. I'll speak to Nestor. I'll\r\nget him to increase the allowance.\"\r\n\r\nShe laughed at him, biting, sarcastic laughter. \"Speak to Nestor! You\r\ncouldn't get Nestor to do anything. He controls _your_ estate. Or\r\ndidn't you know?\"\r\n\r\n\"Judy, please listen. I will--\"\r\n\r\n\"Good-bye Harry. Your ring will--\"\r\n\r\nHe tried desperately to hold her on the screen, cutting in with, \"Judy,\r\nit will be only a year or two until Nestor quits operating. Then we\r\nwill have the estate.\"\r\n\r\nShe was furious. Her anger, smouldering till now, erupted white-hot.\r\n\"_You actually expect me to wait for that senile walking adding machine\r\nto run down?_\" She was raging now, whiplashing him with abuse. \"Why,\r\nyou spineless worm! You cheap excuse for a man! If you were half the\r\nman you pretend to be, you'd _make_ that stupid robot quit operating!\r\nGood-bye!\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe impact of her words had stunned him. He walked to the desk, slumped\r\nlimply, held his head in his hands. Unseeing he stared at the ledgers,\r\nthe much-thumbed journals. His eyes were bleak. Even now, still\r\nreeling under her scorn and smarting under her abuse, he thought of\r\nher. Recalled his last glimpse of her, auburn-haired and red-lipped.\r\nFlinched at the memory of her green eyes, glittering with rage, boring\r\ninto him.\r\n\r\nHe groaned, ran his hands through his dark hair, then rose. His face\r\nwas grim. He walked to the garage, rummaged in the trunk of the little\r\nground scooter, pulled out the three pronged ironite wheel wrench. He\r\ncarried it back to the study, laid it beside the desk and sat down to\r\nwait for Nestor....\r\n\r\nThe old robot shuffled into the study, his diaphragm tubes pulsing\r\nunder the strain of the four square trip to Central National. He\r\npulled a thick roll of orange colored kredits from the pocket of his\r\nblue-serge coat, and handed it to Lowndes. \"There you are, Master,\" he\r\nwheezed.\r\n\r\n\"Thank you, Nestor,\" Lowndes replied. He walked toward the study\r\nwindows, glanced out into the sunlighted patio, then turned back to\r\nface the robot. \"Nestor,\" he said, \"a problem has come up. Do you\r\nthink it could be possible to increase the allowance. You see, I am\r\nplanning marriage.\"\r\n\r\nNestor's magenta eye sockets flickered slightly after Lowndes had\r\nfinished speaking. \"Might I offer a suggestion, Master?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"Go ahead.\"\r\n\r\n\"Master, it is rumored in the city that you have been frequenting the\r\nestablishment of Sliman, the gambler.\"\r\n\r\nLowndes glared at the robot. \"Whadya talking about? What's Sliman\r\ngot do with all this? I asked you if you couldn't work out a liberal\r\nincrease. I want to get married!\"\r\n\r\n\"I have an answer for you, Master. But I thought it politic to mention\r\nthat the odds at Sliman's are definitely against you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Forget about Sliman!\" snarled Lowndes. \"How about the increase?\"\r\n\r\nThe robot's words thudded into Lowndes brain. \"An increase is\r\nimpossible. Master!\" he said. He went on, his aud tones crackling,\r\n\"Indeed, I may have already overstepped in gifting you the five\r\nhundred kredits. The testament and tort attorneys may never allow it,\r\nespecially since it was in payment of a gambling debt! Good day!\"\r\nNestor reached for the black bowler he had placed on the desk and set\r\nit neatly in the center of his worn pate. He picked up the armload\r\nof books and journals, and headed for the door. He turned back for a\r\nmoment to face Lowndes and add \"And Master, if you will forgive my\r\nimpertinence, I should like to say that I do not believe a marriage\r\nwith Miss Judy would be prudent.\"\r\n\r\nIn that moment Lowndes' face turned livid with anger. Seizing the heavy\r\nwheel wrench, he lunged for the blue-clad robot. He brought the wrench\r\ndown squarely in the center of the black bowler.\r\n\r\nSSSSSSSSSSS ... SSSSSSTTTTT ... CRACKLE ... SSSSSSTTTT....\r\n\r\nThe heavy pronged ironite wrench crashed into Nestor's cranial tubes,\r\ndrove through the blue-gray worn pate, sliced into the fragile\r\nold-style gretile metal, battered and shredded the robot's upper works\r\ninto a twisted mass.\r\n\r\nAgain and again, in maniacal fury Lowndes slammed the ironite prongs\r\ndown. Nestor crashed to the floor in a final hiss and crackle.\r\n\r\nLowndes stared at the robot's smashed remains, stared at blue-gray\r\nold-fashioned gretile metal scattered in a twisted heap of powdered\r\ntubes, shredded relays and curling tensit wires. Off to one side the\r\nledgers lay where they had fallen. He reached out and picked up one\r\nof them. He thumbed through the pages, ran his eyes over the lists of\r\nholdings set down in Nestor's precise hand. What was this? The page\r\ntitled Central National showed withdrawals. Where was the balance? His\r\neye riveted on the final figure.... Zero! He threw the ledger down,\r\nreached hurriedly for the other. Hah! here were further listings.\r\nHe flipped rapidly through page after page, intent on the balance.\r\nPage after page--One-World Banking--Coxcomb Trust--Martian Financial\r\nInstitute--Venusian Investors--Cornusian Tex Fund--But--But what was\r\nthis? All showed withdrawals. All showed balance Zero!\r\n\r\nBALANCE ZERO!\r\n\r\nHe sagged against the corner of the desk, his face pale. His hands\r\nshook. Where were the kredits? What had Nestor done with them? Sweat\r\nbroke out on his forehead. Steady, Steady--he dragged himself back from\r\npanic. His mind worked. Let's see. Central National is the biggest of\r\nthe repositories; Nestor held the working capital down there. If he\r\nconverted the kredits, they'd know. He'd tell them; he's dealt with\r\nthem for over eighty years. I'd better go down and find out. I'll tell\r\nthem.... He was busy, his mind churning and twisting, concocting a\r\nstory....\r\n\r\nHe felt much better as he walked toward the study door. Thoughts\r\nintent on Judy, green-eyed, red-lipped, curvaceous Judy, and on the\r\nkredits certain to be invested somewhere in the maze of holdings, he\r\nstepped over the pile of smashed tubes, twisted relays and scorched\r\ntensit wires that had been Nestor. He eyed the pile. Nestor, he\r\nreflected, has met with an unavoidable accident. An accident,\r\ncoincident with a tube failure on Nestor's part, whereby the ground\r\nscooter broke its electronic control and ran over the robot. And in the\r\nsame line of thought ... I shall have to drag him over and stack him in\r\nfront of the garage and use the wheel wrench on the fenders and head\r\nlamps of the scooter. They shall have to be battered to show that....\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHe was smiling as he started for the big, eight-sided structure,\r\nCentral National.... A four square trip, and one which Nestor had made\r\nearlier in the day....\r\n\r\nVice-president Milligan, a thin, narrow-shouldered man who affected a\r\npince-nez greeted Lowndes. He offered a cool hand: \"Mr. Lowndes, this\r\nis indeed a pleasure. We don't see you down here very often. Have a\r\nseat.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, not very often,\" said Harry, dropping the hand and sitting down,\r\n\"Nestor handles the accounts.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, Mr. Lowndes, what can we do for you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Milligan, Nestor has suddenly blown a tube and has decided to turn\r\nin for an overhaul.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sorry to hear that. These tube failures can be so sudden. Matter of\r\nfact, I believe I saw Nestor in our investment department an hour or so\r\nago.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's right, he was,\" said Lowndes. \"But after the tube blew, he\r\nbecame very concerned as to whether the balance he showed in the\r\nledgers was correct.\" Lowndes smiled, \"I told him I'd find out, Mr.\r\nMilligan. Sort of humor him, y'know.\"\r\n\r\nMilligan rose, pulled his pince-nez out of his suit pocket and placed\r\nit squarely on the tip of his nose. He looked over at Lowndes and said,\r\n\"Mr. Lowndes, you are fortunate to have Nestor handle the financial\r\naffairs for the estate. Your father showed exceptional judgment in the\r\nselection. Naturally, we at Central National were elated--why, we've\r\nheld your family's finances and dealt through Nestor for over eighty\r\nyears. In fact, ever since your father organized Lowndes Methodical\r\nInvestments.\" Milligan started for the door, \"Now,\" he said, \"if you'll\r\nexcuse me, I'll go and check on the accounts balance.\"\r\n\r\nHe came back frowning. He removed the pince-nez from his nose and held\r\nit in his hand. He appeared concerned. \"Mr. Lowndes,\" he said, \"Nestor\r\nhas closed out the accounts. Every kredit has been withdrawn--not only\r\nhere, but in all our correspondent repositories.\" He paced back and\r\nforth in front of Lowndes. He stopped, peered down and added, \"A five\r\nhundred thousand withdrawal, Mr. Lowndes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Five hundred thousand,\" repeated Harry. He reached for his\r\nhandkerchief. His forehead was beginning to bead with sweat.\r\n\r\n\"We have explicit confidence in Nestor's ability, Mr. Lowndes\r\nbut--\" Milligan looked sharply at Harry. \"Are you sure he hasn't\r\nhad an unreported tube failure during the past few days? After all,\r\nwithdrawing five hundred thousand kredits--\" he broke off.\r\n\r\n\"Five hundred thousand kredits!\" said Harry.\r\n\r\n\"I agree with you, Mr. Lowndes. Indeed a sizable amount.\" Milligan\r\ngave a weak laugh. \"Naturally,\" he continued, \"we are loath to lose\r\nan account of this size. That is the reason I inquired as to possible\r\nfailure on Nestor's cranial range. His actions certainly have been\r\nstrange--\"\r\n\r\nLowndes interrupted, \"What? What's strange? He was all right this\r\nmorning.\"\r\n\r\nMilligan was agitated. \"Are you sure, Mr. Lowndes? First of all, Nestor\r\ntold Farrell, our investment man that we Cornusians were headed for\r\na recession of even greater severity than that experienced by the\r\nancients in the twenty-ninth year of the twentieth century.\"\r\n\r\nLowndes' hands were shaking. He fumbled for a Martian rolled plovur,\r\nlit it and inhaled the greenish fumes. \"Why,\" he said, \"Nestor told me\r\nthe same thing this morning. What does that prove?\"\r\n\r\nMilligan stared at the greenish fumes with distaste. He did not smoke.\r\nHe said shortly, \"Allow me to continue, M. Lowndes. I am as distressed\r\nby this affair as you are. After all, five hundred thousand kredits.\"\r\nHe broke off, eyed the green fumes curling from the tip of Lowndes'\r\nplovur, then continued, \"Frankly, Mr. Lowndes, I never heard of\r\nanything so fantastic.\"\r\n\r\nLowndes couldn't control his hands. He dropped the plovur on the\r\ncarpet. He stood. He couldn't control his shaking legs. He grasped the\r\nedge of Milligan's desk. \"What-dya mean, you never heard of anything so\r\nfantastic?\" he croaked weakly. \"What'd Nestor tell Farrell he was going\r\nto do with the kredits?\"\r\n\r\nMilligan's face blanched. His voice in turn quavered. \"What? You mean\r\n_you_ don't know? Why, Nestor told Farrell he was going to tell you--in\r\ncase an emergency came up. Farrell says Nestor walked out of here with\r\na great big grip jammed full of the kredits. Said he was going to\r\n_bury_ them. Said he'd be back and redeposit them after the recession\r\nwas going good--when a kredit would be worth a kredit!\""

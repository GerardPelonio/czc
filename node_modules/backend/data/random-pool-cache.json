      "\"The Importance of Being Earnest: A Trivial Comedy for Serious People\" by Oscar Wilde is a play written in the late 19th century. This witty farce revolves around the theme of mistaken identities and the absurdities of Victorian society, focusing on the lives of two friends, John Worthing and Algernon Moncrieff, who both assume fictitious personas to escape their societal obligations.   The opening of the play establishes Algernon Moncrieff's opulent flat, where he converses with his manservant Lane about the complexity of life and marriage. John Worthing, or \"Ernest\" in town, visits Algernon, expressing his purpose of proposing to Gwendolen Fairfax, Algernon's cousin. Through clever dialogue, the two men discuss their escapades and the concept of \"Bunburying,\" a euphemism for creating a fictional identity to avoid responsibilities. This sets the stage for comedic misunderstandings and romantic entanglements that unfold as they both navigate their relationships with the women in their lives, Gwendolen and Cecily Cardew.

      "\"The Souls of Black Folk\" by W. E. B. Du Bois is a seminal collection of essays written during the late 19th century. This work addresses the multifaceted struggles and experiences of African Americans in the post-Civil War United States, focusing on themes of race, identity, and the quest for equality in an era plagued by systemic racism and inequity. Du Bois artfully captures the deep-seated dissonance experienced by Black Americans as they navigate their dual identity within a society that both marginalizes and defines them.  The opening of the book introduces a powerful exploration of what it means to be treated as a \"problem\" in society. Du Bois reflects on his own experiences of growing up Black in America, discussing the profound sense of \"double consciousness\"—the internal conflict of being both Black and American. He delves into the historical context of Emancipation and the ensuing disappointments faced by the Black community, attributing these sentiments to the failure of the American societal structure to fully acknowledge their humanity and potential. As Du Bois lays the groundwork for these discussions, he sets the stage for a profound examination of the African American experience, the aspiration for self-realization, and the urgency for civil rights and education in the face of entrenched racial segregation and prejudice.

Elinor, the practical and reserved elder sister, and Marianne, the passionate and impulsive younger sister, must come to terms with their new circumstances. We also learn about their brother, John Dashwood, who, influenced by his self-serving wife, fails to uphold his father's dying wish to provide for their mother and siblings. The opening chapters establish the sisters' contrasting personalities and set the stage for their romantic entanglements, particularly with characters such as Edward Ferrars and Mr. Willoughby, hinting at the emotional complexities that will unfold throughout the narrative.

      "\"Common Sense\" by Thomas Paine is a historical pamphlet written in the late 18th century. This influential work calls for the independence of the American colonies from British rule and discusses the nature of government and monarchy. Paine articulates arguments that emphasize the rights of individuals and the unjust nature of hereditary rule, setting the stage for a broader discussion about governance, liberty, and the responsibilities of citizens.  At the start of the pamphlet, Paine establishes the premise that government is a necessary evil, arising from the flaws of humanity. He contrasts government with society, portraying society as a product of collective human needs, while depicting government as a mechanism to restrain self-interest and prevent chaos. Through a series of concise arguments, he critiques the English Constitution and hereditary monarchy, positing that America's struggle is not only a concern of the colonies but a pivotal issue for all humanity. He further reflects on the present state of American affairs, urging the need for immediate action toward independence, as reconciliation with Britain seems not only impractical but unjust.

      "\"The Prince and the Pauper\" by Mark Twain is a historical novel written in the late 19th century. The story revolves around two boys, Tom Canty, a poor pauper, and Edward Tudor, the Prince of Wales, whose lives become intertwined due to their striking resemblance and a series of events that lead to them switching places. In this narrative, Twain explores themes of class, identity, and the nature of royalty versus poverty, all while providing a critique of social injustices of his time.  At the start of the novel, we are introduced to both main characters on the same day in London during the 16th century. Tom Canty is born into a impoverished family that does not want him, while Edward Tudor is born to a wealthy family, celebrated by the entire nation. The narrative quickly depicts Tom's harsh living conditions in Offal Court, where he struggles against his family's abusive nature, despite his dreams of a better life. Contrastingly, Edward is surrounded by luxury, yet remains oblivious to the joy that such privilege brings. As the story unfolds, the boys' deep yearning to experience each other’s worlds leads to a serendipitous meeting that sets the stage for their fateful swap, reshaping their lives forever in unexpected ways.

      "\"Divine Comedy, Longfellow's Translation, Hell\" by Dante Alighieri is an epic poem composed in the 14th century. This work is a complex allegorical narrative that explores the themes of sin, redemption, and the soul's quest for divine justice. The protagonist, Dante himself, embarks on a perilous journey through the realms of Hell, guided by the Roman poet Virgil.   At the start of the Inferno, Dante finds himself lost in a dark forest, symbolizing confusion and the recognition of his own sinfulness. As he attempts to ascend a mountain representing salvation, he is blocked by three wild beasts, each emblematic of different vices. In his despair, Dante encounters Virgil, who offers to guide him through Hell and eventually to Paradise, motivated by the intercession of Beatrice, Dante's beloved. The opening sets a tone of reflection and fear while establishing Dante's desire for enlightenment and redemption, making it a compelling beginning to his profound exploration of morality and the afterlife.

      "\"Utopia\" by Sir Thomas More is a philosophical work written during the early 16th century. The book explores the concept of an ideal society through the dialogues of Raphael Hythloday, who discusses the social, political, and economic structures of the fictional island of Utopia. The text critiques contemporary societal issues in Europe, addressing themes such as justice, property, and governance while proposing radical reforms.  The opening of \"Utopia\" introduces the context in which the ideas are presented. It begins with a detailed account of Thomas More's life, depicting his upbringing and career, particularly highlighting his relationship with influential figures like Cardinal Morton and Erasmus. The narrative transitions smoothly into Raphael Hythloday’s account after More meets him in Antwerp, where Hythloday reflects on his travels and observations of various nations, leading to a discussion about Utopia's governance and societal norms. The reader is invited to ponder how these reflections on an imaginary society contrast with the political realities of More's time, setting the stage for an in-depth exploration of Utopian ideals.

      "\"The Sea-Gull\" by Anton Pavlovich Chekhov is a play written during the late 19th century and is notable for its exploration of art, unrequited love, and the complexities of human relationships. The central characters include Irina Arkadina, an aging actress; her son Constantine Treplieff, an aspiring playwright; and Nina Zaryechtnaya, a young girl drawn to the world of the theater. The dynamics of these characters unfold against the backdrop of a rural estate, highlighting themes of ambition, jealousy, and the search for identity.  At the start of the play, the audience is introduced to a range of characters in the park of Sorin's estate, setting the stage for the amateur performance of Treplieff's play. The opening scenes establish conversations that reveal the emotional struggles of Masha, who dresses in black mourning her unhappiness; the conflicts between Treplieff and his mother, Arkadina, regarding the nature of art and personal fulfillment; and the arrival of Nina, who becomes a focal point of affection for both Treplieff and the established author Boris Trigorin. As they prepare for the play, themes of love, artistic ambition, and the inevitable disconnect between reality and aspiration begin to emerge, foreshadowing the deeper explorations that will follow throughout the text.

      "\"The Man Who Would Be King\" by Rudyard Kipling is a short story written in the late 19th century, during the Victorian era. This narrative explores themes of ambition, colonialism, and the folly of human pride through the tale of two British adventurers seeking to become kings in a remote part of Afghanistan called Kafiristan. The story intricately weaves commentary on imperialism, presenting a cautionary tale about the lust for power and the complexities of cultural encounters.  The plot follows two British men, Daniel Dravot and Peachey Carnehan, who decide to leave India behind to establish their own kingdom in Kafiristan, convinced they can conquer the land and rule over its people. Dravot and Carnehan first carefully orchestrate their entry into Kafiristan by disguising themselves as gods, garnering the respect and devotion of the locals as they establish authority. However, their reign unravels as Dravot's desire for a queen leads to a tragic confrontation with the very people who once honored them. This sudden turn reveals the dangers of hubris and the thin veneer of civilization, culminating in a dramatic downfall that serves as a stark reflection on colonial ambitions and their inevitable failures.

      "\"Anthem\" by Ayn Rand is a dystopian novel written in the early 20th century. The story is set in a society that prioritizes collectivism to the extent that individualism is all but eradicated, and follows the journey of the protagonist, Equality 7-2521, as he grapples with the oppressive nature of this world. The book explores themes of identity, freedom, and the struggle against conformity.  The opening of the novel introduces us to Equality 7-2521, who begins writing in secret, aware that self-expression is forbidden. He lives in a society where individuality is considered a great sin, and where people are assigned roles and names by the Council. As he reflects on his life and experiences, he recounts the pain of being different from his peers due to his height and intellectual curiosity. In a world that demands conformity, he yearns to understand his own identity and seeks knowledge, leading him to a discovery from the Unmentionable Times that propels him toward rebellion and self-realization. The reader is drawn into Equality 7-2521’s internal conflict and the oppressive nature of his environment right from the beginning, setting up the stage for his pursuit of individualism against a repressive collective society.
